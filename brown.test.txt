Last Friday the White House announced :
Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem .
Both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February .
The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva .
The response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorable .
The Washington announcement said :
The outlook
The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations .
Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse .
The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development .
It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment .
Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) was a not inapt description .
Today however , the `` outsider '' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university .
And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement .
It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' .
When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services .
Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place .
There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels .
Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating .
The committee remains unresponsive .

The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle .
The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining .

The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves .
He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 .
On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly .
On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus .
Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day .
As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender .
The boldness of champions
Player immediately proceeded to follow suit .
At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green .
This is Baseball 1961 .
This , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees .
Double threat :
`` What do you and Mickey talk about at home '' ? ?
Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken .

It crushed Mickey .
If laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad track .
With this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season .
Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia .

The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation .

Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion .
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ;
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education .
Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest .
The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ;

They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings .
Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other .
Confusion became chaos ; ;
Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites .
The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts .
But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo .
But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country .
High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte .
To Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa .
They chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ;
They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns .
Several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet .

The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities .
As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it .
In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel .
On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then .
A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening .
Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter .
That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike .
The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 .
Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years .
Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins .
Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 .
Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these :
The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years .
The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas .
Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry .
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate .
In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis .
On microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals .

Assembly session brought much good
Certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue .
The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions .
`` If once they become inattentive to the public affairs '' , Jefferson said , `` you and I , and Congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves '' .
By limiting American strength too much to nuclear strength , this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war .
That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by Chairman Charles O. Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials .
Patients deserve more attention than they are getting .

Rafael Trujillo , the often blood-thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years , perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history .
But whether the murder of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered .
Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country : he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably .
The Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed .
For that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy and help .

The new President is in no position to start out his dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs .
But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in Laos , the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot , but would bog Washington in a tactical mess .
But for the safety of Southeast Asia , and for the sake of the Laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made .
Mr. Speaker , Mr. Sam , and Mr. Democrat , at one and the same time .
His leadership was not for audiences .

The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa .
Further , it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned .
Last , it makes no sense to deliver Katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos .

Each state advisory committee documented its own activity .
`` The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights '' .
While some think we move too fast and others too slowly , Florida's record is a good one and stands out among the 50 .
What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result .
If the party of Adenauer and Erhart , with 45 per cent of the vote , approaches the party of Willy Brandt , which won 36 per cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve .
The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility .

But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy .
but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering power .
The widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the Congress , and the Central Committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job .

Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard .
Forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God .
Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness .
In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words , `` Forgive us our debts '' .
It also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past .
Once Peter asked , `` How oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? ?
But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking Cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute .

This year , on a night cool with the front of September moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod .
Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement .

Her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen .
The jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have been , although I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature .
In point of fact , the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live .

Readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks , are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack .
Americans eat too much .
In West Africa , for example , where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace is kwashiorkor , or `` Red Johnny '' , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs : reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kills more than half its victims , leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease .

As a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed .
Just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? ?
We are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected .
Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time .
All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing .
There is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience .
Aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene , it is a quite normal community .
For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night , the demon world is populated with real creatures , and witches actually can be seen flying through the air .
As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community .
If one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit '' .
When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon , a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state '' .
It is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect .
Yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known .
Every community , if it is alive has a spirit , and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity .
If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .
Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?
There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .
Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity .
They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .
Hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; ;
Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism .
The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty .
An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .
At Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .
The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches .
Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ; ;
for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality as well as of mortality .
`` So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord , because of the dominion that had been given to him , and the freedom , fall into sin against God his Creator , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God , a law was given him by God , that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all .
for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ .
These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .
It is the wages of sin , and its sting is the law .
Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry '' to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a `` natural '' religion .
Had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi '' .
Happily for posterity , then , the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .
To the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .
Is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ?
Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked out of the Unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .
And then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for the first time about themselves ? ?
Opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron '' .
Even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , Channing added -- remember , this is Channing , not Parker ! !

We have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial Andrews Norton , by saying that , while he believed Jesus `` like other religious teachers '' , worked miracles , `` I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine '' .
The outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the Bible as the Word of God inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with it the acceptance of our Lord Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God , Son of Man by the Virgin Mary , the Saviour of the world .
Before He left them He promised that His peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds .

Watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something .
The question is : what are we going to do about them ? ?
That is a sound position , but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid .
Read the next two verses : `` When the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .

When that fear has been removed by faith in Jesus Christ , when we know that He is our Savior , that He has paid our debt with His blood , that He has met the demands of God's justice and thus has turned His wrath away -- when we know that , we have peace with God in our hearts ; ;
But this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism .
Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later ; ;
But , up to now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts .
Then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45 ; ;
The existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century B.C. , when the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the most auspicious influences .
His immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the Lo Shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy .
After this time , inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors , as well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one's self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest .
The Yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the Sun ; ;
We have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being Yang , while the even numbers were Yin , so that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center .

Basic needs
The statement also points to a classic paradox : The more men turn toward God , who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another .
Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being .
As much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him .

Several New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .
This article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .
Obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor's role .
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly Negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas .
( 1 ) Most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society .
Discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife .
( 2 ) Realtors realize , of course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing .
One of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work .
But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , American good .
Racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the Creator .
It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere .
An octillion atoms
You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; ;
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body .
Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill .
It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits ; ;
and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine .
And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists .
Harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there ; ;

Long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly .
After 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant background of the older stock .

In China , the magical system par excellence was Taoism .
Nonmagical Confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government .
Promoters of Zen to the West record its ancestry , and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism .
So , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit : the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness .
Then the monk praised Yang Shan saying : `` I have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri , and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya '' , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India , went back through the air .

Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1,000 psi overpressure at 100 feet .

Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea .
Boats are operated in every state in the Union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West .
The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found : the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation's coastline .
It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000 .
The sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace .
There are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience .
The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production .
Of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning power , credit rating and local bank policy .
If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways .
As America on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them .

Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor .
The first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula .
Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated .
The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other .
The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign .
Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport .
Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final computation .

This one was set up here in 390 A.D. on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them .
Retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet , only one with six minarets , I entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle .
One of the most beautiful buildings in Istanbul , it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth Century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade down from it , and smaller full domes around the gallery .
Inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets .
Back at the Kaiser's Fountain , I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the Column of Constantine , also known as the Burnt Column , at the top on my right .
I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately .
Just before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an Oriental pagoda , with Arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet .
Going through a door into another small court , I had the Throne Room directly in front .

To make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips :
-- Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through .
This permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking .

You can build this vacation cottage yourself .
It is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail .
In recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind .
Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials .
Don't worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain ; ;
With this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( AjA version ) and the expandable ( AjB version ) .
The wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard Af and Af of a good grade , free from structural faults .
The battens covering the joints are of Af stock and are applied after the walls are erected .
The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work .

True , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions .
Where to put it
We speak from varying viewpoints .
The placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety .
Coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet .
Had we taken a lien on a state park ? ?
We were in business ! !
We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides .
( To avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area .
Safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together .
When you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent .
You need algaecide .
You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water .
When shed , they leave rust marks .
Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid .
Housekeeping is easier .
When you're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter .
The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms .
It can go in out-of-the-way waste space .
You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house .
A BTU is a unit of heat , and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour .
By accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12,000 BTU of cooling in one hour .
A 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 BTU to well over 10,000 Aj .
The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself .
Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can .
The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need .
Gas adds to the moisture load .
Good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you're doing your own contracting , don't award the job on the basis of price alone .
Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning .
These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies .
The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site .
For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study .
Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site .
Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas .
Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in .
size and shape
An area may be too small for the needs of the project .
Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be .
Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas .
Look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera .

Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure .
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities .
How right he was ; ;
Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth Symphony ; ;
Of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them .
Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se .
At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; ;

`` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color .
Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat .

It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics .
The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection .
Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better .

He was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis .
However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals .
His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong .
The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey .

Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target :
Wider discretionary choices for customers .
Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? ?
As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do .
If you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? ?
`` Selective selling '' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers .
Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? ?
As a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved .
If competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store .
On the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive .
and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ?
In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still .
Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need .
The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties .
They have to be .

Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants .
Fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade '' .
The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog .
When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth .
Long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence .
No one can deny that these `` back door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies .
At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' .
The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed .
Are you careful to restrict the number of people on leave at one time so that your total employment obligation is minimized ? ?
Plant feeding facilities
Have you considered using vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria employees ? ?
Are there possibilities of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or other jobs ? ?
Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity strain on your feeding facilities ? ?
Would it be feasible to limit the menu in order to reduce feeding costs ? ?
Can part-time drivers be assigned to other productive work ? ?
Aim to balance your employee benefit package .
Communications
If you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they're entitled to .
Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job .
But with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing .
And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today's hunting and target shooting .

This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use .
Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades .
More campers than campsites
The U.S. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily .
The American Automobile Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 .
The AAA then splits it down this way : $10.50 for meals , $9.50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous .
And even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces .
But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs .
Throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad .
Since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed .
All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures .

`` A serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level .
Promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit .
The salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) .
Publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies .
The earlier New Haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture .
In other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-State .

Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties .
The final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit .
It is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use .
Sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft. wide , make up the 25-ft. length of the sign .
Frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc. .
The background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely .
On large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e.g. right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate .
Letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways .

Following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new .
However , after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe , you'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places .
You can relive history and follow , in fancy , the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot .
An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road .
For those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage .
The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one .
The disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy tourist season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all .
At some cities , this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are budget-wise , when you are planning your itinerary , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries .

All model cars are not available in all countries .
For one thing , the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road .
Conclusions : The people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental .
The point -- quite simply -- is this : words they might have had ; ;
In the early 1950's , Smith , together with his distinguished colleague , George Trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell ( Ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and `` tone '' of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial expressions , and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head , `` talking '' with one's hands , et cetera .
The usual U.S. norm would be : Af Middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end .
He may then very well conclude that `` everybody '' is probably not the true target of her resentment .
She says later , but still within the opening five minutes , `` I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death '' .
so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce .
almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again .
Naturally , the patient does not say , `` I hate my father '' , or `` Sibling rivalry is what bugs me '' .
( This patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty .
Secrecy was paramount .
`` For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures .
A British officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped .
`` It's up to you to protect yourselves .
Not fire until the bombs came down ! !
Like hell ! !
Ensign Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put Seaman 2/c Donald L. Norton and Seaman 1/c William A. Rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette .
The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette .
It was `` window '' -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers .
They had come from airports in the Balkans , these hundred-odd Junkers 88's .
This experience will have happened to many of you .
Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion , just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences .
At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement , suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene , action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier .
I recall the startling , vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town .
Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed , but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence .
But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain ? ?
As a matter of fact , the incorrect classification , the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht , was about to be published by him the following day .
After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt .
But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene .
The concept of good nutrition really began with the garden .
`` Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist '' .
The basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds .
`` You can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread '' , was an early complaint .
Finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem .
The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues .
Since Mr. Clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons .
Healthier children
And once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems .
During the excitement following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes .
As a matter of fact , Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers .
His work began just six days after the flood .
And besides you seem to make it all right here '' .
With a wary eye on the farmer's bull , Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr. St. John marked the field with a red table cloth .
Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country .
At Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated .

Everything must balance to the last penny .
Actually , you can take no special credit for this .
What's happened ? ?
You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it .
Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you ? ?
Some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by the hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work .

An animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .
It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .
It is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator .
First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen .
( Hymen , in fact , is the Greek word for membrane .
As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina .
Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration .
Such talk is seriously in error .
The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire .
Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period .
The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the `` natural , honest , free expression of man's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration '' .
One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected .
In the past , it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive .
But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed .
And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .
In one extreme case , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .
After every money argument , she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor .
She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband .
One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik , New York psychiatrist , that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor .
She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .
Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .
Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction '' .
Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .
In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France , where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him .
`` Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke '' .
Diane sobbingly denied this to the court .
`` That's a lie .
`` Diane is the type of girl '' , Jelke said , `` who wouldn't get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor '' .
She quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business .
The audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment .
Smarter than most gamblers , she slipped away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to Paris .
No one ever learned what happened to the Greek .
`` You can't do this to us '' , Diane screamed .
They also called upon Diane with a request for a look at her passport .
) He knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his `` cosmic light ozone generator '' machine .
Did she know , he asked , why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health ? ?
The human body -- he pointed out , for example -- required 33 units of blue light .
For that reason , he informed her , the Lord made the sky blue .
Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day .
His plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions .
Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business .
Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland .
Sarah Gross , a dress shop proprietor , paid $1020 to a masseur , and Mr. A. , a laborer , paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' .
By preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate , by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care , these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity .
Yes , Tom caught it in time to stay alive .
Carroll diagnosed Mrs. Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his `` radionic '' machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ) .
( Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 for his wife's death .
`` Unfortunately '' , says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens , who has prosecuted many device quacks , `` the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court '' .
They are often ignorant as well as underprivileged .
During the year that followed , Dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance .
occlusion is the dentist's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed .
A noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw .
Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition .
Parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay .
Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth .
The reason ? ?
Most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years .
In many cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee .
growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists .
Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately .
In other cases , in view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment .
The child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth .
For this was to be a `` proxy sitting '' .
Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how `` elastic '' these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case .
to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase , `` Atta boy '' ! !
If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame : `` Does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life ? ?
That is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls .
Conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material .
Does she often speak of locations , of cause of death ? ?
Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view : `` a house under a pine tree , with a little stone path going up to the door '' .
Even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere , of one another's personalities , moods , intentions .
Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value .
Even if there are no livestock , the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods , particularly during the growing season .
Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price , higher if it has subdivision possibilities .
It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment .
This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented .
If the farm is rented , the rent must be paid .
Caring for a calf , a pig , or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work .
Land , labor , and equipment needed
For larger plantings , you'll need some kind of power for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating .
Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm .
The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .
If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk , for example , you should be close to a town or city .
Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes .
Few rural areas are protected by zoning .

Check on the schools in the area , the quality of teaching , and the provision for transportation to and from them .
You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them .
If you can't tell , get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist .
For almost two months , the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers , graybeards , adolescents , babies , starved , beaten to death , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned .
in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism , with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard .
If anti-Semitism was on trial in Jerusalem , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press , in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs , as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites in Germany , as well as in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary ? ?
The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry , transportation , civilian agencies of government .

Three agreed , but four declined and were suspended .
These are substantially the same factors considered by Non-Catholics in family planning .
Thus , man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation , the propagation of the race .
Moreover , man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God , who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception .
Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable .
Since then , many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements , in which they not only approved birth control , but declared it at times to be a religious duty .
The general board declared : `` Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right .
This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation , but in the realm of conscience and religion : They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief .
What happened to the fourteen missing men ? ?
Not enough to do away with all doubts , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage .
Nearly twenty-five years before , Captain John Davis had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic Circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides '' .
Ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters .
Philip Staffe , the ship's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent .
And he refused to be anything else .
He was a Londoner , married , with three sons .
Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames .
The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome .
For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd .
When Hudson had finished , the `` town meeting '' broke down into a general , wordy argument .
On August 3 , two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before , so far as Hudson knew , seen by Europeans .
To starboard was a cape a thousand feet high , patched with ice and snow , populated by thousands of screaming sea birds .
Hundreds of miles to the north , the route back to England through the `` Furious Overfall '' was again filling with ice .
Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial .
Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward .
Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland .
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food .
On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River , Robert Dickson , Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada , had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces .
It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United States .
This traffic , he declared prophetically , `` tho' it might be of small account at first , would increase with the progress of our Settlements .
The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected .
As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818 , the company suspected that the Pembina colony -- its own post and Fort Daer -- was on American territory .
After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick .
Despite this prohibiton , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs .
With their customary source of supply cut off , the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country .

Charles Thiot , a splendid Georgia soldier , differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation , well-educated , and nearly fifty years of age .
Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups , name one of them `` Fall-in '' and the other `` Close-up '' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end of Fall-in and Close-up '' .
The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people .
Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the `` the Virginia quickstep '' .
Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads .
A Yank writing from Vicksburg , May 28 , 1863 , stated : `` not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced writing .
Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers .
A Massachusetts soldier , who seems to have been a Civil War version of Bill Mauldin , wrote : `` the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks .

This has not , however , prevented publishers from labeling him a `` folk poet '' , simply because he is a rural one .
As part of the same arrangement , Torrio had , in the spirit of peace and good will , and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign , bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade .
the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted , at a cost of $30,000 in bribes , it was estimated .
He was also personally active in ward politics , and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : `` I always deliver my borough as per requirements '' .
Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds .
This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone .
O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave , severely wounding him in the stomach .
One of the beer-runners telephoned O'Banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation .
Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen .
But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman .
Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable .
Not until they sailed home at the end of the day , through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses , were they aware of what had happened .
The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest .
Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands .
The moment the alarm goes off , information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu , which is the center of the warning system .
By means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations , it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific .
Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence .
Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude .
But it is plain that a warning system , however efficient , is not enough .
The land , too , is changing , and earthquakes are daily reminders of this .
We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth's interior , for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled .
Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts .
Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history , or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name .
Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism , for in the modern Army , esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables .
Instead Sergeant Early was quiet , sharp and confident .
It was the 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial Palace of the Emperor .
The final proof was a small incident .

Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear .
Chandler , looking to right and left to see how his men were faring , suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill , hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran .
It was Bob Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen .
Enemy reinforcements came pouring down , seeking a soft spot .
Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` Garryowen '' ! !
and because Communists have the will and , as long as Soviet power remains intact , the capacity to prevent their realization .
but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression , then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made .
The uses of power
This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat Communism -- and , if so , how those resources ought to be used .
The other charge was that America's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years .
But contrary to what was implied during the campaign , prestige is surely not important for its own sake .
To the extent , then , that declining U.S. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation , there is reason for concern .
In answering these questions , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests .
To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring .
In the Middle East , Iraq , Syria and Egypt were , a short while ago , in the Western camp .

Many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard , but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water ; ;

Now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ! !
A really good wine waiter is , paradoxically , the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the Visigoths .
The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money .
No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this , and to give fair warning where warning is due , no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ! !
Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration , and any red wine , brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime , should be uncorked and allowed some air .
A few red wines , notably those of the Beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature .
By tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well .
very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself .
Another school frowns on such a shortcut , and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom , after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle .
Decanting old wine aerates it fully ; ;
the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red Burgundy .

William , who lived in neighboring St. Mary's parish , had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year .
Early in January , 1844 he had a conference with Henry and William in New Orleans , and upon learning of Gorham's intention , Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother .
The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs , he contended , but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless Negroes .
They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation , and Louisiana law required their removal from the state .
William , who did not write to Gorham , told Giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year , he would sue `` amicably '' to protect his interests .
Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety , Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial .
The memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and Civil War .
In fact , as the time for their departure approached , his solicitousness increased .
On March 21 , 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor at New Orleans , while on the levee Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation .

Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in `` importunately '' .
`` Their house '' , writes Albert S. Flint , `` was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer , especially grateful to one like myself far from home '' .
What was called an `` accidental meeting '' with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman .
her great love of flowers and plants and birds ; ;
Miss Upton and Miss Packard , as a matter of fact , had many tastes in common .
Yet they thrived on it .
She noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence ; ;
She urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission .
The raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired , and the spontaneous `` praise demonstration '' held afterward on the campus , were reported as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles .
and when school closed , she was unable to travel to Massachusetts .
But she decided to stay at Spelman .
She helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography , rhetoric and bookkeeping .
The books of the school hold a memorial to her ; ;
With infinite patience she responded to every call , no matter at what cost to herself , and to her all went , for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer .
The `` distributive education '' program operates in a similar way , with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields .
Fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .
Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .
To be sure , in tool-and-die work and in the building trades , the first job must be often on an apprentice basis , but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status .
In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained .
The suburban high school , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs .
It is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment , except for a lucky few .
Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest .
Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment , this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students .
The efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil .
The demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops .
One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds .
Seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world .
Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions .
All nut kernels are rich in protein .
The color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations .
Bead tree seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba .
Each year millions of pounds of anise , caraway , mustard , celery , and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported .
Arrack is distilled from fermented rice in India .
Cereal grains , oilseeds , and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised .
To hold 'em in a compact mass was `` close herdin' '' .
This term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight , as one cowhand was heard to say , `` He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm '' .
The Injun's name for beef was `` wohaw '' , and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun on the trails .
Rarely did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for `` wohaw '' .
This throwed the animal off balance , and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders .
The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up the trail `` Sonora reds '' , while they called all cattle drove up from Mexico `` yaks '' , because they came from the Yaqui Injun country , or gave 'em the name of `` Mexican buckskins '' .
An animal with distinct coloration , or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders , was sometimes used as a `` marker '' .
The counters rode through the pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle , and drifted it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead .
Hyena ? ?
At the base of the rocky hillside , they left their horses and climbed on foot .
At this moment , Loveless and Means arrived , crashing through the undergrowth with their horses , and distracted her , and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks .
The dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John .
`` We've got to get her out of there '' ! !
Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice , and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed .
It was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again .
Ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles , and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago , not the gentler ones of today , and this one was angry , with good reason .
But without waiting for them to try it , she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain .
With the gully on three sides , she could be approached only along the tongue of land .
A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion , from a standing start .
This new position , however , gave the ropers a better chance .
There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went .
However needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world .
The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .
It has a beautiful edifice .
It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .
The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New York Yankees , bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins .
Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's schema of `` identity vs. identity diffusion '' as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier .
The successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence , the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend , to a considerable degree , on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy , childhood , and early adolescence .
These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters .
In the specific case of time diffusion , we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society , and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust .
The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2 , , revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty .
Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis .
Erikson has noted that , as this indecision mounts , it may result in a `` paralysis of workmanship '' .
Sex was both .
Most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages , as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values .
The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed , however , in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty .
`` It is a duty '' , said Hough , `` not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity , current in this circuit ( and probably others ) , excused if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court , especially to be found in patent causes , and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation .
He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case record ; ;
Not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the Selden suit .
Noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar , he admitted that some of the strictures `` were fairly well founded '' , but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent .
While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation , these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money .
Nevertheless , it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade .
One of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement , a milestone in the development of American industrial cooperation .
Many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories , among them tires , detachable rims , ball bearings , license brackets , and electric horns .
After the demise of the A.L.A.M. , the time was propitious for establishing such a pool .
Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents .
Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days .
Here is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome , the Fontana delle Tartarughe or `` Fountain of the Tortoises '' .
)
The courtyard is magnificently decorated .
Standing before the tomb of Raphael , the great genius of the Renaissance , when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple , you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of Rome .
A few yards farther , on the Via Dei Bergamaschi , is the Piazza Colonna .
Rare , indeed , is the Harlem citizen , from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent , who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence , injustice , or brutality .
What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like men .
People who have mastered Kant , Hegel , Shakespeare , Marx , Freud , and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable .
A kind of panic paralyzes their features , as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place .
My recital disturbed him and made him indignant ; ;
They do not escape Jim Crow : they merely encounter another , not-less-deadly variety .
the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent , chopping up the rooms , and all but dispensing with the upkeep ; ;
he found it , if anything , all too familiar .
Negroes are , therefore , ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South , and suffer hideously in both places .
the fact that American Negroes rioted in the U.N. while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white Americans .
God knows what the African nations , who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U.N. were thinking -- they may , for example , have been thinking of the U.S. abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom was before the Assembly -- but I think I have a fairly accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking .
It was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death .
Now , I do not doubt that , among the people at the U.N. that day , there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives .
it is also the rate of photographing .
In narrative , time is essential , as it is in film .
It was Porter , however , who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued .
One reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in 1915 .
The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies .
you are cutting .
This is what Porter did .
Time and space have both become cinematic .
With few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city .
In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial `` contacts with friendly members '' .
the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; ;
In general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; ;
Whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people .
Its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation .
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages , who might be habitants , voyageurs , or even soldiers .
In accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians .
During his first administration , Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country .
The director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods , of a kind to which they were accustomed , to supply the Indian needs .
The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district .
The Chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana .
They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region , from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French settlements near the Gulf .
In spite of the company's restrictions , he planned to build new posts in the territory .
The difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs , and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families .
This was a slow and difficult course , and French trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders .
Congress is a harsh master .
Nothing worked .
Rooney remained untouched .
The Department's constant fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the Senate .
John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson , who was then operating the Senate , refused to let it become an Inquisition .
During Dulles's first two years in office , while Republicans ran the Senate , the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945 .
They range from the Soviet Embassy on Sixteenth Street , a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house , to what Congressman Rooney has called `` that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street '' , the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the Belgians .
Other embassies cable home The New York Times without changing a comma .
Each has its peculiar style .
When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin , he made a determined effort to change this idea .
Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy , he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried : `` Up your bottom '' ! !
The State Department was little help on this , or on much else about Saudi Arabia .
It's the only copy I've got '' .
`` Twenty-one '' , replied the sheik .
When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt , he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo , a language as anarchic as Casey Stengel's .
The next day I visited International Christian College which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan well .
The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom .
The following morning Mr. Morikawa called for me , and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten , middle-school , elementary school , and high school -- Mr. Yoshimoto's school .
Six of the science teachers were present , and we had great fun .
My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would meet me at the hotel , but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome .
There seemed to be no excuse ? ?
In his big home live four families and thirty people , so it needs to be big .
Also , there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings , lacquer , brocade , etc. .
I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little , after which Mr. Uno would arrive and pilot me around .
But there he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand .
They knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event , and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people , who hold no grudge , but who also regret Pearl Harbor , I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan .
There were no words to say this but there was no need .
On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took us immediately to her university , the Japanese Women's University .
The suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the South , and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York and general company policy .
R. B. Gregg has written that `` non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu , to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance .
He suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him '' ; ;
and in warfare with any means , men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause .
A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression .
An excellent article was published recently in the Journal Of The Church Peace Union by a South African journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa , amounting to virtual slavery , and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the United States in these conditions .
Both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail .
They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state .
Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals .
Time's editor , Thomas Griffith , in his book , The Waist-High Culture , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep South ) I found myself unsympathetic to .
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy , but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism .
There are of course many Souths ; ;
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; ;
And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia , which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century , bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown .
If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .
And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent .
and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town .
( That corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .
A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment .
The general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i.e. , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history .
That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; ;
It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations .
The content is not the same , however : rather than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an `` ideological group '' -- those in the `` free world '' -- that is basic .
The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism .
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in which `` popular '' sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in which the jobs of government are split .
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it : `` You can't have dry runs on this one '' .
The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will -- but possibly might .
Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security .
These men are not callous .
The chain starts at BMEWS ( Ballistic Missile Early Warning System ) in Thule , Greenland .
to the SAC command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base , near Omaha , Nebraska ; ;
The same principle of `` redundancy '' applies to all communications on these special networks .
A system of `` gold '' -- actually yellow -- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the SAC commander and other key men .
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from Aj .
For these centers , too , are on the gold circuit .
No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate .
At General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone .
But Wisman , too , does not know the go code .
`` I'd wind up full of bullet holes '' , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers .
In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no more .
Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction .
It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve .
They ran for three hours .
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly .
The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps .
I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived `` outback '' for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush .
I asked .
But if you don't know the place like the palm of your hand , you'd better use a compass and the speedometer .
No one patted the dog .
We drove close to the boulder , stopped the Land Rover , and walked over toward the family .
The ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut .
There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what .
There was also a boomerang , elaborately carved .
`` That smell is something , eh , mate '' ? ?
The Australian asked .
The stink is all the same to me , but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded '' .
I should like , by the way , to make it clear that I am not using the word `` Persians '' carelessly .
he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage .
These are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed .
Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools .
Above all , they will stop in the middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry .
Poetry in Persian life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms -- all may stand .
It is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own .
Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade .
Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and so on , to include all of the emotions .
Because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes , he composed his own studies .
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and De Falla's La Vida Breve .
Other world premieres will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba Concertante .
`` It is easy for you to talk '' ; ;
They thought of themselves , to use Jefferson's words , as `` the Argonauts '' who had lived in `` the Heroic Age '' .
When the Revolution broke out , he , along with Jefferson and Jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice .
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends .
The state's rights position was formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves , but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians .
Indeed , it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live -- but only as a weary , overexploited phantom .
Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance .
This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ; ;
There is a New South emerging , a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche -- especially within recent decades .
Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted ? ?
This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem .
Today's evidence , such as the fact that only three Southern states ( South Carolina , Alabama and Mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness .
While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South , such men appear to be a vanishing breed .
All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life .
Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; ;
The fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night riders .
Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact .
In each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer .
The work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience .
The concept remains subjective .
Others look to more objective devices of order .
He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers .
According to Katherine Litz , `` the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance '' .
The sequence may involve a sharp contrast : for example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap ; ;
Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive .
Thus , there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well .
But I would never have thought of it myself '' .
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee .
Repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather than clear thought and timely action .
Here are the two Preambles : Federal Constitution , 1789
If the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union .
Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes .
And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact .
Consitutional government , popular vote , trial by jury , public education , labor unions , cooperatives , communes , socialized ownership , world courts , and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples .
They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual .
It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice .
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls .
If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .
Small wonder , then , that we fear .
There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear .
The persistent horror of having a malformed child has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control over this misfortune , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it .
His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday , and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve .
They find deep pessimism in them .
Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that `` Waiting For Godot '' is `` the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair '' .
Is his a literature of defeat , irrelevant to the social crises we face ? ?
It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in .
And why not ? ?
But it is different at Chartres .
If there were only darkness , all would be clear .
Two thieves are crucified with Christ , one saved and the other damned .
At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination , but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark .

`` All is not sex '' , declared Lawrence .
Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy .
That is reserved for the squares .
The mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ; ;
One girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion .
Boredom is death .
some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality .
Their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void .
Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks .
From maturity one looks back at the succession of years , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length in the number , however large .
the lilacs themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach ; ;
More potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them .
Thus shielded , we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; ;

The highroad , one might say at first , belongs to life , while the way to the churchyard belongs to death .
But that is too simple , and won't hold up .
This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad .
that is , on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness , Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life -- not only the cyclist now , but the audience , the world , as well : `` all you light-headed breed '' .
This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal .
This is simple enough , but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant .
The season , between spring and summer , belongs to life in its carefree aspect .
as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : `` His justice is not of this world '' .
The ambulance is drawn by two `` charming '' little horses .
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home , and `` before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees , and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated '' .
The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes .
Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together .
All artistic and mythological representations , therefore , are `` imitations of imitations '' and are completely superseded by the truth value of `` dialectic '' , the proper use of the inquiring intellect .
But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths .
The central concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved .
I have chosen to use the word `` mimesis '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which , as in the Christian mind , are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind , only to moments of theoretical reflection .
The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings , both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; ;
It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern , devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection .
Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am .
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school , and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer , for one thing ) .
By what right of superior virtue , Southerners ask , do the people of the North do this ? ?
A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change .
But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' .
it can be changed ; ;
) and was repealed .
One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the THIDIU viewpoint , It Doesn't Affect Us ! !
A man must be able to say , `` Father , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him .
Can God be mocked , ever , in the long run ? ?
And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ! !
It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations .
In one of his summers at home he married , to the great disapproval of his father , who objected because of his extreme youth .
It was a brilliant debut , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets , as did Byron's Childe Harold .
It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum , next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence .
The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as `` Thoughts in Loneliness '' is , as Professor Book indicated , in sharp contrast with the others .
A dominant motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : `` Not men-folk , but the fields where I would stray , The stones where as a child I used to play '' .
The hero , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East , a sort of Faustus type , who , to quote from Professor Book again , `` even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life .
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity .
About one-third as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .
Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam .
There are , however , some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part , concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity .
He finds it in utter misery and desolation .
The record teems with romance and adventure .
He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ) , but because he enjoys his work , because he firmly believes that murder must be punished .
By virtue of his self-reliance , his individualism and his freedom from external restraint , the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost .
There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : Adam Smith was wrong .
If he is good , he may not be legal ; ;
As he informs Watson , `` My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence .
These little problems help me to do so '' .
The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior .
On the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine .
Watson's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch-opponent , Dr. Moriarty .
Their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a Sherlock Holmes .
Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house , and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids .
virtue is its own and only reward .
The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer .
The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another .
Thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system , but there is one weakness .
The crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six , with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes .
The dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure , the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort .
Without monitoring , a military hookup becomes a noisy party .
Alexander the Great , who used runners as message carriers , did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once .
Commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank .
The commands are specified by the military regulations ; ;
A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command .
This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action .
The number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55,987 men .
Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great , we will merely discuss it .
It is a weakness of Gabriel's analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy .
During the decade that followed , the common man , as that piece put it , grew uncomfortable as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow ( Wilson ) only to learn from Science , to his shocked relief that after all there was no God he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow -- that there was a chemical formula for him , and that too much couldn't be expected of him .
The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution , freedom from want and fear , seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier .
What had happened to the common man ? ?
The long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy , into a worship of man , led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State .
We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework , finally and at last , to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations .
We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation .
All of this , I know , is recent history familiar to you .
I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle , with its limited and precarious success , toward conservatism .
I saw a piece the other day assailing William Buckley , author of Man And God at Yale and publisher of The National Review , as no conservative at all , but an old liberal .
But there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook .
Does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? ?
So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation .
Asked which institution most needs correction , I would say the corporation as it exists in America today .
Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e.g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports .
Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth .
We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders .
In my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , I have been able to do many things for my employees which `` normal '' corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do .
Perhaps a list of some of the `` practices '' of my company will help here .
Merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration .
Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock , but probably he never saw a Jew , unless in some of his travels .
The Jew was the safest victim .
No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater .
But what a super-Herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely , particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes , in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy .
In the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage .
We would establish no censorship .
It is of the utmost importance to the people of America and of the world how their governing President `` ends up '' during the four years of his term .
The double editorial on Two Aspects Of `` The U.S. Spirit '' was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles great as well as small , reflecting popular approval of this questionable attitude toward the highest office in the land .
`` My doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great '' .
Moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him , he adopts a position that is morally indefensible .
This does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked .
He chooses to subordinate one to the other , sometimes reluctantly , accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed .
For the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community .
In this phase of change , no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community .
If we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two , one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke .
The second involves something deeper , but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for the community , not in the truth on which the community rests .
For paradigmatic history `` breaks '' rather than unfolds precisely when the movement is from order to disorder , and not from one order to a new order .
Civilization itself -- tradition -- falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused .
A number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process .
And when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence , any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence .
Unanalyzed responses
Weil identifies it as being `` rootless '' , Guardini as being `` placeless '' , Riesman as being `` lonely '' .
And the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status .
In its defensive formulations , the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community .
In both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality .
The point is that the reactionary , for whatever motive , perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself , something which , consequently , he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference .
Now we can argue that the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward , but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history .
There are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse .
It was , of course , a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to himself , and replacing the father who could not give her the things she wanted -- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like -- but if it were only this the story would be banal .
And when the child dies in Lawrence's story in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make his mother rich , the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all .
He would not have cared why it emerged , he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy .
The young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge ; ;
There is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories I have encountered in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth .
In both the farmer's tale in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and in Thomas Mann's The Holy Sinner , the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting the wish as motive ; ;
Thomas Mann wrote The Holy Sinner in 1951 .
The infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him .
An ivory tablet in the infant's cask recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village .
Grigorss , at seventeen , learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his origins .
At the end of this period two pious Christians in Rome receive the revelation which leads them to seek the next Pope on the rock .
Later Helion wrote of this phase : `` For years I built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships -- colors and forms without a name .
I played on it my secret songs , unexplained , passionate and peaceful '' .
The extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly arid and cold .
He himself did not know , as he said in 1935 .
`` We were possessed by visions of a new civilization to come , very pure and elevated '' , he has said , `` in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918 '' .
Helion also hoped that America's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works .
When he was stripped , deloused and numbered by his guards , his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners' goods to be confiscated .
In the Stalag , Helion came to know and love his comrades , most of them plain folk , who , in their extremity , showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other .
Their sentry followed .
And , after all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford , Mississippi , and Charlottesville , Virginia .
These narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers , as a rule , and later found their way between book covers , though rarely into the planters' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of Horace , Mr. Addison , Mr. Pope , and Sir Walter Scott .
There would be side-conclusions to be drawn , of course ; ;
such capacities are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of biologists and organic evolutionists ; ;
Actually , you could wish for some passion , now and then , but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos of current history which partisan social passions have wrought , you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized calm .
After casting about for a way of describing this spirit , we decided that it would be better to use Mr. Lyford's introduction as an illustration .
Mr. Nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by our Department of State , and an American President observes sourly that Sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more capitalistic '' .
Nor did a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their nocturnal flights .
Because motion which begins and ends at discrete places would ( e.g. for Aristotle ) be incomplete .
Pure fire ( the stars ) is in the heavens .
The stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth .
But none of this has prevented scientists , philosophers , and even historians of science , from speaking of the Ptolemaic system , in contrast to the Copernican .
It is engendered by confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in The Almagest with the geocentric astronomy .
The Axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully , so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms , rules , and primitive notions .
De Revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques .
The formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being Copernicus' primary concern , was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy , namely , the ' unphysical ' triplication of centric reference-points : one center from which the planet's distances were calculated , another around which planetary velocities were computed , and still a third center ( the earth ) from which the observations originated .
Henrietta's feeling of identity with Sara Sullam was crowned by her discovery of the coincidence that Sara's epitaph in the Jewish cemetery in Venice referred to her as `` the Sulamite '' .
She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist , of showing her superiority in argument over a man .
And , in the last case , a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature .
Dr. Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of Sara Sullam that he considered submitting it to the Century Magazine or Harper's but he decided that its Jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in The Messenger , `` so our readers will be benefited instead '' .
And she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas Maccabeus performed at the Hanukkah festival which came in December .
In September '76 Thomas Huxley , Darwin's famous disciple , came from England to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the University ; ;
A smart , shrewd and ambitious young man , well connected , and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people , he was bound to go far .
so Cyrus Adler became interested in her friend Racie Friedenwald , and Joe Jastrow -- the only young man who when he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta , and signed himself Joe -- fell in love with pretty sister Rachel .
Henrietta could easily identify herself with Jo March , although Jo was not the eldest sister .
Neither was Henrietta hoydenish like Jo , who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately shortened her name , which , like Henrietta's , was the feminine form of a boy's name .
and , as in the March home , any young man who called on the Szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them .
There were three years of this strange warfare ; ;
`` Madame Noel , I think you had better go '' , said Mrs. Cupply .
Wright set his loss at $200,000 , a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined , and the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and other things that were destroyed .
In spite of the disaster , Wright completed during this period plans for the Lake Tahoe resort , in which he suggested the shapes of American Indian tepees -- a project of great and appropriate charm , that came to nothing .
He said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could be brought to an end , and that the bank would accept a mortgage on Taliesin to help bring this about .
`` Volstead laws , speed laws , divorce laws '' , he said , `` as they now stand , demoralize the individual , make liars and law breakers of us in one way or another , and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd .
If Mrs. Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning , I'll go either to Tokyo or to Holland , to do what I can .
Perhaps this is not so little .
In any case , Miss Millay's sweet-throated bitterness , her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love , her constant and wonderfully tragic posture , so unlike that of Fitzgerald since it required no scenery or props , drew from the me that I was when I fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea .
I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal .
What I fled from was my fear of what , unwittingly , you might betray , without meaning to , about my father and yourself .
Instinctively , innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by .
You , I could swear to it , remained innocent in this sense until the end .

Our surplus from foreign business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas , to finance private investment , and to provide assistance to the less developed nations .
In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments approached four billion dollars .
Otherwise , the outlook could be dark indeed .
But I once again assure all peoples and all nations that the United States , except in defense , will never turn loose this destructive power .
The deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores , on land and sea , is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security .
This conference was held despite Stavropoulos' assurance to Adolf Berle , who was leaving the same day for Puerto Rico , that nothing would be done until his return on January 22 , except that the Secretary General would probably order the list destroyed .
`` Until this Hungarian Committee matter came up , Bang-Jensen was a fine and devoted individual .
I had known him for some years , when I was a delegate and before , and this manner had never been his '' .
Gross had received Marshall courteously and they were discussing the case .
Marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs .
Gross swung his swivel chair .
`` For instance , regarding the fact that the Gross Committee issued two interim announcements to the press during its investigation .
What was the list ? ?
Of course the matter caught the public's attention .
as I understand it , Mr. Hammarskjold wanted outside advice .
Mr. Stavropoulos is the U.N. legal chief and a very good man , but he is not fully versed on some technical points of American law '' .
`` The case was that Bang-Jensen came up to Shann claiming he had found further errors in the report .
So once again Shann had to argue with him about this .
( Shann's own report , Peter Marshall reflected , describes the encounter as `` immoderate '' .

Walking was the remedy , they decided , but a deck full of chicken coops and pigpens was hardly suitable .

As for the author of the Englishman , Mrs. Manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the Protestant cause should be left to `` Ridpath , Dick Steele , and their Associates , with the Apostles of Young Man's Coffee-House '' .
Steele's main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a Stuart Restoration .
Like Burnet , he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis .
Steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan .
Defoe then commented , `` If they Could Draw that young Gentleman into Their Measures They would show themselves quickly , for they are not asham'd to Say They want only a head to Make a beginning '' .
The final issue of the Englishman , No. 57 for February 15 , ran to some length and was printed as a separate pamphlet , entitled The Englishman : Being the Close of the Paper So-called .
Thus he complains , with considerable justice , that the Tory writers have resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments .
Steele first answers briefly the charges which his `` dear old Friend '' has made about his pamphlet on Dunkirk and his Crisis .
If `` Jack the Courtier '' is really to be taken as Swift , the following remark is obviously Steele's comment on Swift's change of parties and its effect on their friendship : `` I assure you , dear Jack , when I first found out such an Allay in you , as makes you of so malleable a Constitution , that you may be worked into any Form an Artificer pleases , I foresaw I should not enjoy your Favour much longer '' .
this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared in the Tory press , especially the Examiner .
On February 16 , Steele took his seat in Parliament .
It is filled with the usual personal abuse of Steele , especially of his physical appearance ; ;
When Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer , begun some years before .
Still , he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the Woodberry Forest School , near Orange , Virginia , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well .
`` We'd give him things to deliver , letters , checks , deeds and things like that '' , remembers his half-brother Walter , still in the real estate business in Savannah , `` and learn days later that he'd absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket .
This rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in Mercer's personality ever since .
But Mercer's explanation was simple : `` I made out the check and carried it around a few days unsigned -- in case I lost it '' .
When the family business failed , Mercer left school and on his mother's urging -- for she hoped that he would become an actor -- he joined a local little theater group .
When the troupe traveled to New York to participate in a one-act-play competition -- and won -- Mercer , instead of returning with the rest of the company in triumph , remained in New York .
Though merely clear glass , it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers .
The innocent malfeasant , filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle -- and did , over the protests of the former owner -- with a square monacle .
Mercer is supposed to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monacle must be affected '' ! !
This 1930 edition also had songs in it by Vernon Duke and Ira Gershwin , by E. Y. Harburg and Duke , and by Harry Myers .
Mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs .
with Harry Warren he did `` The Girl Friend Of The Whirling Dervish '' , `` Jeepers Creepers '' , and `` You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby '' .
Speaking of his work with Johnny Mercer , Arlen says , `` Our working habits were strange .
Arlen , too , worked on other projects at the same time with old friend Ted Koehler .
A much larger room , adjacent to the lavatory , served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet .

I worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own well-informed sources .
He stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk .
He exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters , Nat Ferber and Carl Helm .
The unfinished note , written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope , and addressed to the coroner , makes one wonder about many things : `` God forgive me for everything .

Diversity of perception , yes ; ;
The `` conventional '' image of a particular time and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as established over the years by scholarly and scientific research .
Predispositions , in turn , fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis .
What factors condition the degree of realization at various times and places ? ?
It is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate ; ;
the future weight of informal factors cannot be so easily assessed .
the process can be accelerated .
Now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach ; ;
What we have in mind does have something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods by which they are sought .
For this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary ; ;
Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time .
The reader , observing this process , might ask `` why not be different '' ? ?
The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be , like the models he sees , even more like everybody else .
One would need to test this proposition carefully ; ;
Men seem almost universally to want a sense of function , that is , a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized .
A need so deeply planted , asking for direction , so to speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature .
F.S.C. Northrop , in his discussion of The `` Functions And Future Of Poetry '' , suggests this : `` One of the things which makes our lives drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end of the day , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern of common-sense objects .
In the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate .
I mean something more like Freud's concept of the utility of `` play '' to a small child : he plays `` house '' or `` doctor '' or `` fireman '' as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences , reliving them imaginatively until they are under control .
The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment : contrast the perceptual skill of English professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars , political candidates , or female beauty .
But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap .
The late R. G. Collingwood , a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature , once wrote `` : :
We are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with Chaucer and Cimabue , or even Shakespeare and Titian .
Many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding .
Outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself , including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries ; ;
On the other hand , Arnold's `` The unplumbed , salt , estranging sea '' , taken in its context , certainly does so .
`` The Attorney General has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a doorknob for eighteen months '' , Hearst said .
What I want is to have this evidence come before Congress and if the Attorney General does not report it , as I am very sure he won't , as he has refused to do anything of the kind , I then wish that a committee of seven Representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence .
Roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of McKinley .
They were repelled by his noisy newspapers , his personal publicity , his presumptuous campaign for the Presidential nomination , and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses .
Even the regular Democrats disowned him .
Some preferred Judge Alton B. Parker of New York .
His candidacy affected his journalism somewhat .
The Hearst men say that if Hearst is nominated , he and his immediate friends will contribute to the Democratic National Committee the sum of $1,500,000 .
The alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds , and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a Democratic victory absolutely fruitless .
`` There's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up .

But fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification of Italy , a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at the time of publication .
Already Trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century Italian studies with several works on English figures of the same period .
The biography of Lord Grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all .
The volume is a piece of passionate special pleading , written with the heat -- and often with the wisdom , it must be said -- of a Liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians from 1782 to 1832 .
Some historians have found his point of view not to their taste , others have complained that he makes the Tory tradition appear `` contemptible rather than intelligible '' , while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the `` intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which , at times , politicians are the ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents '' .
By what one reader called a `` series of dissolving views '' , he merges one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth .
But after 1832 , the narrative tends to lose its balanced , many-sided quality and to become a medley of topics , often unconnected by any single thread .
Like most major works of synthesis , The History Of England is informed by the positive views of a first-class mind , and this is surely a major work .
Of the three volumes , Blenheim is easily the best .
I stood on a table , surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces .
They would champion me .
We would all meet at ten o'clock at the Kehl bridge , five miles from Strasbourg , and march triumphantly across into Germany .
In fact , all persons were permitted to cross the Rhine into Kehl , there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river .
I marched up to the waiting officials , the students massed behind me .
As usual , the press photographers were on hand .
I mean ''
The students crowded around asking questions , slapping me on the back , and generally being friendly .
A special guard was posted at my end of the bridge to make sure I didn't cross , the ludicrousness of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else -- men , women , and children , dogs , cats , horses , cars , trucks , baby carriages -- could cross Kehl bridge into Kehl without surveillance .
When I informed her that I didn't , she said she would borrow her brother's and bring it to me later that evening .
In the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of Cologne , Heidelberg , and Baden-Baden .
Twenty thousand world citizens at Stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town .
`` Oh , Mr. Davis , are you there '' ? ?
May we have a word with you '' ? ?
`` I'm sorry .
By both standards Thomas had the right to be proud .
Whatever the military world thought , the political world approved it wholeheartedly .
Halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war .
Men were killed in their camps , at their meals and in their sleep .
As always , the ranks worked out new and better tactics , but there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their military thinking .
Sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old .
At such times Thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike him .
That was a very absurd and annoying situation in which I was placed by W. M.'s curious methods of handling me .
It need hardly be remarked that Thompson was not generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements , which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant .
For them a box will be lodgment enough .
Katie cannot mind your seeing them now ; ;
If otherwise , you will give me a pleasure .
Taking into account Thompson's capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known unhappy loves , there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for Katie King .
The poems which were addressed to her , while they are far more restrained than those of `` Love In Dian's Lap '' , show no great technical advance over those of the `` Narrow Vessel '' group and are , if anything , somewhat more labored .
Their interest remains chiefly biographical , for they throw some light on the utter despair which overtook Thompson in the spring and early summer of 1900 .
Reviewing Davidson's The Testament Of An Empire Builder , for example , Thompson found that there was `` too much metrical dialectic '' .
Yet Davidson impressed him as a poet capable of `` sustained power , passion , or beauty '' , and he cited specific passages to illustrate not only these qualities but Davidson's command of imagery as well .
But he admired Housman's `` subtle intellectuality '' and delighted in the inversion by which Divine Love becomes the most `` fatal '' allurement in `` Love The Tempter '' .
Potemkin's Army of Ekaterinoslav , totaling , it was claimed , 40,000 regular troops and 6,000 irregulars of the Cossack Corps , had invested Islam's principal stronghold on the north shore of the Black Sea , the fortress town of Oczakov , and was preparing to test the Turk by land and sea .
the energetic Parisian , Roger De Damas , three year's Littlepage's junior , to whom Nassau had taken a liking ; ;
In the great one's personal quarters , a portable house , almost every evening saw an elegant banquet or reception .
There's a man who never goes by the ordinary road but still arrives at his goal , who gratuitously gets himself into difficulty in order to get out of it with eclat , in a word a man who creates monsters for himself in order to appear a Hercules in destroying them '' .
To help him do so The Prince had conferred control of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost every respect save one : both were eccentrics of the purest ray serene .
He had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side , a large flat nose , and penetrating blue eyes .
But Suvorov's face was also a theater of vivacity , and his tough , stooping little frame was briskness embodied .
Like all Russians he was an emotional man , and in him the emotions warred .
Suvorov's contempt for don't-know's was proverbial ; ;
For those little men with the short whiskers , shaven polls , and top knots Suvorov reserved a special esteem .
Potemkin -- as King Stanislas knew , and presently informed Littlepage -- looked on the Cossacks as geopolitical tools .
It was probably at this period that Littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary Russian soldier .
They emerged as interchangeable cogs in a faulty but formidable machine : shaved nearly naked , hair queued , greatcoated , jackbooted , and best of all -- in the opinion of the British professional , Major Semple-Lisle -- `` their minds are not estranged from the paths of obedience by those smatterings of knowledge which only serve to lead to insubordination and mutiny '' .
At this moment Mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem was solved and all Norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers .
We saw it frequently afterward , but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset .
More than twenty-four hundred years old , bruised , battered , worn and partially destroyed , combining to an astounding degree solidity and grace , it still stands , incomparable testimony to man's aspiration .
the atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home .
This agreeable state of affairs is explicable , I think , on two counts .
The road , a comparatively new one , is very good , winding along inlets , coves , and bays of deep and brilliant blue .
There is a mediocre restaurant at Sounion and I fed a thin little Grecian cat and gave it two saucers of water -- there was no milk -- which it lapped up as though it were nectar .
We therefore leave the writer to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd to which he belongs '' .
The strategy worked perfectly .
Pike was stunned by the first blast against his character , which was published in the March 4th issue of The Gazette under the name `` Vale '' .
Without further inquiry , Pike jumped to the conclusion that Robinson was guilty , and , following the honorable route that would eventually lead to the dueling ground , sent a message to Robinson through his friends , demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity .
Woodruff was furious .
He got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his good luck .
From his first bout with the canny Woodruff , Pike had learned that it was better not to attack him directly , so , harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too high , he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs to exist .
As a consequence , he did neither .
He was especially popular with women , for , like the romantic poetry he wrote , he was personally gracious , gallant , and chivalrous .
A biographer called him `` the premature John the Baptist of New England Transcendentalism '' .
It had been whispered privately that she had smiled in the congregation , and the Governor Prence sent to knoe her business , and command , after punishment as the bench see fit , her departure and also anyone who brought her to the place from which she came ' '' .
When , in March , 1640 , the two towns were united under Coddington , Gorton claimed the union was irregular and illegally constituted and that it had never been sanctioned by the majority of freeholders .
Then he became involved in a ruckus remarkably similar to the one in Plymouth .
Since Rhode Island at that time did not have such sanction , his opinion was not popular .
Master Gorton , having foully abused high and low at Aquidneck is now bewitching and bemaddening poor Providence , both with his unclean and foul censures of all the ministers of this country ( for which myself have in Christ's name withstood him ) , and also denying all visible and external ordinances in depth of Familism : almost all suck in his poison , as at first they did at Aquidneck .
Some few and myself withstand his inhabitation and town privileges , without confession and reformation of his uncivil and inhuman practices at Portsmouth ; ;
Gorton and company , however , promptly bought land from Miantonomi a few miles south of Pawtuxet , extending from the present Gaspee Point south to Warwick Neck and twenty miles inland .
One historical authority presents laborious and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion that Massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down on the embattled Gorton .
Promptly their livestock was taken and according to Gorton the soldiers were ordered to knock down anyone who should utter a word of insolence , and run through anyone who might step out of line .
When the captives arrived in Boston , `` the chaplain ( of their captors ) went to prayers in the open streets , that the people might take notice what they had done in a holy manner , and in the name of the Lord '' .
`` Dr. Glenn , I've got a lot of blood '' , Fred spoke up , `` plenty of it .
That was in the days before blood banks , of course , and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to patient .
`` Why can't I , Doctor '' ? ?
It's too late now .
he was given the difference between that amount and $5000 .
But he had succeeded well , we agreed .
For years Papa and Mama had been large taxpayers .
`` Merciful God , Julia '' ! !
I believe there are seventeen short plays by Tom now housed in the Houghton Library at Harvard ; ;
it was visiting University of North Carolina alumni in New York to ask them for contributions to the Graham Memorial Building fund .
The man , Tom said , explained that it was not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort of thing the public wanted .
The basic difficulty , I suppose , was in my ultimate inability to feel a burden of sin from which I sought relief .
This doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense .
and the doctrine of original sin is compounded of injustice .
Deity and Law are one and inseparable .
or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive .
On the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between the two '' .
Perhaps it should have .
An uncompromising belief in the moral law has the advantage of making religion natural , even as physical law is natural .
This truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries .
There is indeed a moral responsibility on man himself , for his own soul's sake , to respect lower life and to avoid the infliction of suffering , but this viewpoint Schweitzer rejects .
The Australian aborigine is the conventional exemplar of degraded humanity ; ;
As our radius of penetration , R , increases , the area of new knowledge increases by Af , and the total of human knowledge becomes measured in terms of Af .
Wonder grows .
Plato and Aristotle
When he turns briefly to literary style , in the Third Book , he again looks to the effect on the audience .
And with this point about the passions , we encounter Plato's dualism .
The same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both Babbitt and More , that we must examine it in some detail .
Plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something of an enigma , because he is so completely sensitive to its charm .
Once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms , he lays down his famous definition of tragedy , which sets up standards and so lends direction to the remainder of the work .
And we can add that Krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to Plato's fear that poetry will encourage our passions .
And , contrary to many popular assertions , the goal-values chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic success nor to mere conformity .
Our students want occupations that permit them to use their talents and training , to be creative and original , to work with and to help other people .
For there is also the `` face of reality '' in the form of the individual's perceptions of his own abilities and interests , of the objective possibilities open to him , of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed .
The interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which students tend to converge include toleration of diversity .
To the extent that our sampling of the orientations of American college students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our culture -- and still valid in 1959 -- we are disposed to question the summary characterization of the current generation as silent , beat , apathetic , or as a mass of other-directed conformists who are guided solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscopes .
Morgan himself had sciatica again .
A few days later it was learned that General Howe was planning an attack upon the American camp .
After complimenting Morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to Congress , too , the ardent Frenchman added he felt that Congress should make some financial restitution to the widow and family of Morris , but that he knew Morgan realized how long such action usually required , if it was done at all .
Morgan hotly denied this and informed the Board of War that the men in camp linked the name of Peters with the plot against Washington .
Even the dignified Washington indulged in a game of wickets with some children .
Meantime , however , this same General Smallwood seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the American army .
Morgan took the suggested steps , but when Mrs. Sanderson appeared , there was nobody with her but her husband , whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned .
For by now the original cause of the quarrel , Philip's seizure of Gascony , was only one strand in the spider web of French interests that overlay all western Europe and that had been so well and closely spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to the other .
It is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures on the pope .
They had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence and astuteness , they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles like Othon or even the older generation of clerks like Hotham , and they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized .
The younger men , Vere , and Pembroke , who was also Edward's cousin and whose Lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that caused Edward of Carnarvon's irreverent friend , Piers Gaveston , to nickname him `` Joseph the Jew '' , were relatively new to the game of diplomacy , but Pontissara had been on missions to Rome before , and Hotham , a man of great learning , `` jocund in speech , agreeable to meet , of honest religion , and pleasing in the eyes of all '' , and an archbishop to boot , was as reliable and experienced as Othon himself .
But all the reports of this first embassy show that the two Savoyards were the heads of it , for they were the only ones who were empowered to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably absent .
Underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys was the inescapable fact that Edward would have to desert his Flemish allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain , the king of France , in return for being given an equally free hand with the insubordinate Scots .
The store was their marriage , and when Alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together .
Tessie , everybody thought , was a strong woman , but she was only strong because she had Alfred to lean on .
Alfred began to put his affairs in order , and he went about it like a man putting his things into storage .
The day Alfred left his home and Fleischmanns he gave up the convictions of a lifetime .
Solemnly he walked me back to Alfred's house without a word passing between us .
The car was waiting for him .
Alfred nodded a little nod and went out through the door .
Harry ran to the side of the car where Alfred was sitting and looked at him , begging him to speak .
He was a learned man and a very gentle soul .
They lived in the same house and it didn't seem to be such a hard thing to do , but the sad realities of Lilly's life and the fact that Meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful thinking .
When the work was finished , we would walk .
When we went for our walks Lilly's brother would come along every once in a while .
Karl was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it was strange to see the expected become the unexpected .
He spoke no German but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew in a foreign language .
The turn of the century , or to be more precise , the two decades preceeding and following it , marks a great change in the history of early English scholarship .
And with the publication of E. T. Leeds' Archaeology Of The Anglo-Saxon Settlements the student was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data then known .
In sum , it can be said that the techniques and standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century .
Following him in varying degrees of scepticism were T.W. Shore , H.M. Chadwick , Thomas Hodgkin and F. G. Beck .
In the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars , H.M. Chadwick , R.H. Hodgkin , Sir Frank Stenton et al. who are in varying degrees sceptical of the native traditions of the conquest but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggested by them .
As a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual Germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of their work , e.g. Seebohm , Gray and Finberg , tends to obscure their sympathies .
It is no longer possible to say that a sceptical attitude towards the received accounts of the invasions almost automatically produces a `` shore occupied by '' interpretation .
The primary reason for the abandonment of the `` shore occupied by '' thesis has been the assimilation and accumulation of archaeological evidence , the most striking feature of early English studies in this century .
Even earlier Haverfield had come to the same conclusion .
What they meant was that there was no evidence to show that the south and east coasts of Britain received Germanic settlers conspicuously earlier than some other parts of England .
Where there were none fifteen years ago , several scholars currently are edging their way cautiously towards the acceptance of the `` shore occupied by '' position .
He concluded that selective service would not only prevent the disorganization of essential war industries but would avoid the undesirable moral effects of the British reliance on enlistment only -- `` where the feeling of the people was whipped into a frenzy by girls pinning white feathers on reluctant young men , orators preaching hate of the Germans , and newspapers exaggerating enemy outrages to make men enlist out of motives of revenge and retaliation '' .
Start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if I am obliged to go to Congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration '' .
Democrat Stanley H. Dent , Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee , declined to introduce the bill .
The world-wide total of deaths from `` Spanish flu '' was around twenty million ; ;
When the United States entered the First World War Baker made certain that the Draft Act of 1917 prohibited the sale of liquor to men in uniform and that it provided for broad zones around the camps in which prostitution was outlawed .
Ultimately Fosdick's `` Fit to fight '' slogan swept across the country and every well-known red-light district in the United States was closed , a hundred and ten of them .
This was the negative side of the situation .
The wholesome activities were to be provided by many organizations including the YMCA , the Knights of Columbus , the Jewish Welfare Board , the American Library Association , and the Playground and Recreation Association -- private societies which voluntarily performed the job that was taken over almost entirely by the Special Services Division of the Army itself in World War 2 .
But we abide by their insight .
We see at once what Victor Hugo means when he calls Macbeth a northern scion of the house of Atreus .
But it is true , nevertheless .
The wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre .
And the fate of such men has tragic relevance because it is public .
Until the advent of rational empiricism the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic and allegoric .
There can be no greater magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all , in whom beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible .
The Bishop of Gloucester described the elder Thomas in 1577 as the richest recusant in his diocese , worth five hundred pounds a year in lands and goods .
His daughter Elinor married Quiney's son Adrian in 1613 , and his son Henry married Mary Lane of Stratford in 1609 .
Allso that if monei might be had for 30 or 40 a lease & might be procured '' .
Adrian Quiney wrote to his son Richard on October 29 and again perhaps the next day , since the bearer of the letter , the bailiff , was expected to reach London on November 1 .
Baker wrote : `` I tooke order with Sr. E. Grevile for the payment of Ceartaine monei beefore his going towardes London .
Baker added : `` I pray you delivre these inclosed Letters And Comend mee to Mr. Rychard Mytton whoe I know will ffreind mee for the payment of this monei '' .
A court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling that the law is inimical to the numerical majority .
Here was another indispensable tool .
This is not to assume that his work was without merit , but the validity of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be considered against this background of an unprofessional approach .
Such manipulations are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression of the monasteries during the English reformation .
All of Adams' work reflects this dogmatic characteristic .
Religion without supernaturalism
But it was nothing more than that .
Students of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that there was , indeed , a direct connection .
Doctrine was not only mysterious ; ;
The relic worship and monasticism of the Middle Ages were more advanced forms than were primitive fetish worship and nature myths .
Yet , the idea imbedded in each was identical : to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of God .
Stephens had written his classic `` incidents of travel '' about these regions a hundred years before , and Catherwood , who had studied Piranesi in London and the great ruins of Egypt and Greece , had drawn the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text .
He was a captain , he said , in the army , and on the train to New York his purse and all his money had been stolen , and would I lend him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the General Delivery window ? ?
Then he began to have epileptic fits .
We found that a charitable society in New York had a long case-history of the two ; ;
Two or three times , C. C. Burlingham came to lunch with us in Weston , that wonderful man who lived to be more than a hundred years old and whose birthplace had been my Wall Street suburb .
but I liked to think of him at ninety swimming and working at Key West long after Hemingway had moved to Cuba .
I had to confess that I had missed these frescoes , recently discovered , that he had studied in his eighties .
I should have replied , `` I probably know something about the best part of you '' .
And that was the end .
They would go to New York together , where parties would be piled on weariness and on misery .
`` This whole Washington venture was my last gesture , and it has failed .

He had been , he wrote Mencken at once , `` in the country '' , a euphemism for an experience that had not greatly changed him .
She was occupying herself in an attempt to write an article about the variety of houses that they had rented abroad .
Nevertheless , Mrs. Lewis was still solicitous of his condition : let him do as he wished , let him sleep with chambermaids if he must , but , she begged Blackman , try to keep him from drinking a great deal and bring him back in good health .
Blackman had brought news from Kansas City .
Of course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of education he received .
It differed from what an undergraduate receives today from any American college or university mainly in the certainty of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates .
He had also learned to dispute extempore remarkably well , the main evidence for which of course is the presence of his name in the honors list of 1628/29 .
His statements about sports and exercises of a physical nature are suggestive , but inconclusive .
But these prolusions that we have surviving from the Christ's College days are only one phase of his existence then .
but even in that famous passage , Milton was aiming not at the theatricals as such but at their performance by ' persons either enter'd , or presently to enter into the ministry .
Childhood's End -- apparently indebted to Kurd Lasswitz's Utopian romance , Auf Zwei Planeten ( 1897 ) , and also to Wells's Histories Of The Future , especially , The World Set Free ( 1914 ) and The Shape Of Things To Come ( 1933 ) -- describes the bloodless conquest of earth by the Overlords , vastly superior creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for its next stage of development , an eventual merging with the composite mind of the universe .
A more complete list would also include Bradbury's `` The Pedestrian '' ( 1951 ) , Philip K. Dick's Solar Lottery ( 1955 ) , David Karp's One ( 1953 ) , Wilson Tucker's The Long Loud Silence ( 1952 ) , Jack Vance's To Live Forever ( 1956 ) , Gore Vidal's Messiah ( 1954 ) , and Bernard Wolfe's Limbo ( 1952 ) , as well as the three perhaps most outstanding dystopias , Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth's The Space Merchants ( 1953 ) , Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano ( 1952 ) , and John Wyndham's Re-Birth ( 1953 ) , works which we will later examine in detail .
and the atmosphere is so befouled that no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs .
A mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself a little less obviously as old or young .
Let me then ( and in public ) glance into the mirror .
but I am so aware of an uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that I see only as absurd the tendency of some psychologists from Heraclitus to Pirandello and Proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which nothing remains unchanged .
So far as I am concerned , the child is unmistakably father to the man , despite the obvious fact that child and father differ greatly -- sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse .
There was , it seems to me , enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of Russian leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait to see how it would turn out .
Not only his parishioners , but the whole town and , ultimately , the whole county were enormously impressed by this object lesson .
Despite these facts the question `` : :
For here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to counterbalance Existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to the tarnished image of the species Man , or , as Malraux himself puts it , `` to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves '' .
The work as it stands is not the entire book that Malraux wrote at that time -- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called La Lutte avec l'Ange ; ;
and this first section was somehow preserved ( there are always these annoying little mysteries about the actual facts of Malraux's life ) when the Gestapo destroyed the rest .
Even so apparently impartial a critic as W. H. Frohock has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece of Loyalist propaganda ; ;
Nothing , however , could be farther from the truth .
The narrator is an Alsatian serving with the French Army , and he has the same name ( Berger ) that Malraux himself was later to use in the Resistance ; ;
These biographical analogies are obvious , and far too much time has been spent speculating on their possible implications .
`` He was not much older than myself , '' writes the narrator , `` when he began to feel the impact of that human mystery which now obsesses me , and which makes me begin , perhaps , to understand him '' .
'' Finally , after almost being beaten to death by a madman -- he could not fight back because madmen are sacred to Islam -- he throws up his mission and returns to Europe .
This has been his first encounter with mankind , and , although he has now become a legendary figure in the popular European press , it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied .
`` For six years my father had had to do too much commanding and convincing , '' writes the narrator , `` not to understand that man begins with ' the other ' '' .
The United States might well have exploited the opportunity provided by the European Recovery Program to push the hesitant European nations toward political federation as well as economic cooperation , but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the United States Government at the time .
Besides its historical significance as a break with the centuries-old tradition of British insularity , Britain's move , if successful , will constitute an historic landmark of the first importance in the movement toward the unification of Europe and the Western world .
Underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a conviction that the nations of the North Atlantic area do indeed form a community , at least a potential community .
what is new and compelling is that the West is now but one of several powerful civilizations , or `` systems '' , and that one or more of the others may pose a mortal danger to the West .
Rexroth is a longtime jazz buff , a name-dropper of jazz heroes , and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz .
In San Francisco he has worked with Brew Moore , Charlie Mingus , and other `` swinging '' musicians of secure reputation , thus placing himself within established jazz traditions , in addition to being a part of the San Francisco `` School '' .
Beauty as well as love is redemptive , and Patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation .
The private detective must rely , as the Youngest Son or Trickster Hero does in primitive myth , on his wits .
But since 1945 , Sam Spade has undergone a metamorphosis ; ;
The differentiation between the East Coast and West Coast schools of jazz , the differences between the `` hard bop '' school of Rollins , and the `` cerebral '' experiments of Tristano , Konitz and Marsh , the general differences in the mores of white and Negro musicians , all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public .
the accent is on improvisation rather than arrangements .
In order to write with authority either about musicians , or as a musician , Patchen would have to soft pedal his characteristically outspoken anger , and change ( at least for the purposes of this poetry ) from a revolutionary to a victim .
This involves a shift in Patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz poetry .
Perhaps tracing some of these more important symbols through the body of his work will show that Patchen's new poetry is well thought out , and remains within the mainstream of his work , while being suited to a new form .
Henry Miller characterized Patchen as a `` man of anger and light '' .
His revolutionary anger is apparent in most of his early poems .
I do not want to quibble about typicality ; ;
in a certain sense , one manner of experience will be typical of any given group while another will not .
Only a native New Yorker could believe that New York is now or ever was a literary center .
he displays what outlanders call the New York mind , a state that the subject is necessarily unable to perceive in himself .
Krim says , in short , that he is a suffering Jew .
Had Krim gone farther from New York than Chapel Hill , he might have discovered that large numbers of American Jews do not find his New York version of the Jews' lot remotely recognizable .
More important is the simple human point that all men suffer , and that it is a kind of anthropological-religious pride on the part of the Jew to believe that his suffering is more poignant than mine or anyone else's .
And again , `` how can you write when you haven't yet read ' Bartleby The Scrivener ' '' ? ?
Krim came to believe that `` the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning '' .
The work for Commonweal was more satisfying than work for Commentary `` because of the staff's tiptoeing fear of making a booboo '' .
Both magazines were `` rigid with reactionary what-will-T. S. Eliot-or-Martin Buber-think ? ?
What Krim ignores , in his contempt for history and for accuracy , is that these magazines , Partisan foremost , brought about a genuine revolution in the American mind from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950 .
When Partisan and Kenyon set up shop , Mencken was still accepted as an arbiter of taste ( remember Hergesheimer ? ?
over , the , country -- .
if it had never printed a word of literature its contribution to the politico-sociological area would still be historic .
The Italians felt it .
He was interested in Italo Svevo .
It was going to be hard going all the way because he hadn't written seriously for a while , except for a few stories , was tired of the old method of realismo he had so successfully used in The Sky Is Red .
This one was going to be different .
He had bought a little piece of property down along the coast of the hard country of Calabria that he knew so well .
So did his friend , the young novelist Rimanelli .
Around that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos and there is a glowing view of the whole city , in that park are the rows of marble busts of Garibaldi's fallen men , the ones who one day rushed out of the Porta San Pancrazio and , under fire all the way , up the long , straight narrow lane to take , then lose the high ground of the Villa Doria Pamphili .
We had walked it many times and shivered , figuring what a fish barrel it had been for the French .
He said it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that , no matter who gave the order and what for .
I thought : Who is older now ? ?
Object -- a village crossroads .

This would show that somebody , even a foreigner living in Rome , cared .
Were any of us interested enough in the idea to do it for her , by proxy so to speak ? ?
I had some reasons , too .

These problems frequently arise where a firm is making items for the Government not directly along the lines of its normal civilian business or where the Government specifications require operations that the firm did not understand when it undertook the contract .
SBA works closely with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those types of property that small business concerns are most likely to be interested in purchasing .
Proposed property sales of general interest to small business concerns are publicized through SBA regional news releases , and by `` flyers '' directed to the small business concerns .

Only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation .
First , we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs .
It must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions .
U.S. aid , therefore , should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take .
Aid advice is not interference
Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country's development potential , we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur .
The major areas of self-help are the following : ( A ) the effective mobilizing of resources .
fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation ; ;
( B ) the reduction of dependence on external sources .
For both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country .
In many societies , what we regard as corruption , favoritism , and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly .
A requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run , but it is politically essential in the long run .
But there will be still other countries where , despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help , we shall deem it wise , for political or military reasons , to give substantial economic assistance .
Many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods .
or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed .
For the dignity , the influence , and the power of the legislative branch of our Government -- it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country .
He is most effective in the ordinary business of the House , and in the legislative accomplishments of this session , he easily rose to great occasion -- even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle -- and as the Nation witnessed these contests , he rose , even as admitted by those who differed with him , to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan .
It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise , respect , and affection for Speaker Sam Rayburn .
In this hour of crisis , the wisdom , the dedication , the stabilizing force that he represents in current American government is an almost indispensable source of strength .
In the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community , our district , our State .
For what Sam Rayburn's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district .
Meaningful policies include : ( A ) kinds of cars the state should own , ( B ) when cars should be traded , ( C ) the need and assignment of vehicles , ( D ) use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances , ( E ) employees taking cars home , and ( F ) need for liability insurance on state automobiles .

This responsibility included all phases of management .
It met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more popularly called the motor pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation .
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation .
Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles .
At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well .

Multiply the population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage .
Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment .
Regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 -- increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000 .

A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont's share of the General Motors market .
Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors' eight operating divisions .
The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest .
Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies .

While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage .
By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U.S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection .
and his conviction is sustained .
Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board .
Haydn C. Covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner .
On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin , Assistant Attorney General Wilkey , Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop .
On March 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1-a classification .
The appeal board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department's recommendation .
Apparently he never took the trouble to find out .
He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; ;
Moreover , the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney General and , of course , is not the recommendation of the Department .
Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board .
In addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes .
But this is fully answered by United States v. Nugent , supra .
We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments .
While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort .
He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can .
The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility .
Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered .
Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history .
He knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it .
How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted ? ?
Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body ? ?
He is interested in public opinion for two reasons : first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind .
For readjustment to the U.S. , volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service , based on the length of time served .
The Peace Corps , therefore , offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the American people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development .
Within a year or two several thousand might be in service .
There would , however , be a variety of other skills -- medical , agricultural , engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects .
In presenting it to other governments and to the United Nations , we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee .
In any case , our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as technician helpers in development projects of the U.N. and other international agencies .
Our own freedom , and the future of freedom around the world , depend , in a very real sense , on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity , liberated from the bonds of hunger , ignorance and poverty .
To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers , sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations .
This organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work .
They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments , acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice .
The total adverse impact of disease , insects , fire , weather , destructive animals , and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized .
This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations .
The work will consist of : 1 .

This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled fire-fighting crews , and equipment use .
These are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another .
The long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services .
For the year 2000 this means servicing ( A ) the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year , ( B ) recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors , ( C ) a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet , and ( D ) 60 million acres of rangelands .

-- This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a year-end strength of 2,489,000 men and women in the active forces .
I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity .
I again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve -- from their present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000 , respectively , to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961 .
Military personnel costs .
Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures .
In total , these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces .
Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 .
As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known as the Buy American Act .
Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile .
The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program .
The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it .

Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night .
These curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data .
Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others .
With respect to other frequencies , these are designated as regional or local , and assigned for use by class 3 , and class 4 , stations , respectively , stations operating generally with lower power .
9 .
Since then , there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena .

During the year 1959 , we granted 354 Fellowships ; ;
That development , in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular graduating , in index drilling , and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement .
This process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities in the situation .
Budget increased
Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers' mills .
These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn packages , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn .
This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry .
This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute .
Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities .
All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick .
In addition , land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future .

I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 .
In contrast to the lower turnout of TV , total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million ( excluding export ) .
Separate phonographs also had a good year , reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market .
Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960's , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing , industrial process control , and information storage and retrieval .
In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year .
Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 .
Mr. Devey first came to Sprague in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department , coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington , D. C. , where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies .
Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs .
by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments ; ;
A busy president , conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is .
The need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation .
At one university , the president cites the faculty review committee as `` a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty '' .
Before the president recommends a candidate to the trustees , the administration collects the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere .
In particular , the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale .
For the president , a master plan looking ahead five years ( the maximum reach for sound forecasting ) , offers several practical advantages .
Trustees , faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of afterwards .
Some offices have very broad responsibilities , touching on almost all aspects of a university's instructional program .
The president's opportunity for influencing education reaches its highest point , as he decides which projects he will cut back , which he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts .
Just as the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy and objectives , so should non-academic officers .
Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance .
Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets .
No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported , and , because of their distances , small diameters , or low temperatures , the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity .
This was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25-cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett ( 1949 ) .
This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction , and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved .
The moon
Very recently , observations have been made at 8-mm wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2' ( Amenitskii , Noskova , and Salomonovich , 1960 ) .
The observations of Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker at 3.15 cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described .
The measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon's disk is nearly uniform .

The heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up Af .
The following possibilities exist for achieving this : 1 .
The third method was , to our knowledge , successfully applied for the first time by C. Sheer and co-workers ( Ref. 2 ) .
A detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper .
A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts .
This arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection .
The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator .
1 .
The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made .
The argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between Af and Af .
As it turned out , a very hot region occurred on the plug .
Its temperature was denoted by Af .
This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned .
A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time .
The minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to H and equating to zero .
If they are not ellipsoids , the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation .
( B ) That because of the low viscosity of the fluid , the internal pressure is the same in all directions .
This means that work equals Q which in turn equals Af .
It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure .
We first discuss the Af bond in Af .
The information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the Af bond in Af .
Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical Af distance is reached , below which it will become symmetric .
Af .
Since Af is ferromagnetic , we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated Af would be suspect .
Plane suggested another preparation of Af which we used here .
A modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality , was used .
A single measurement of the spin - spin relaxation time Af was obtained at 10 Mc/sec by pulse methods .
light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder ; ;
A well-publicized entrant which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent , with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder/active ratio .
Large numbers of potential builders have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice .
In hard-surface cleaning , the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active .
In an essentially static system , an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent .
and natural waters , in addition , often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove .
It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals , as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond .
reagents .
The silver chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant product of Af which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line .
Purified inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break seal .
-- The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5 mm. i.d. and about 15 cm. long .
Exchange was also observed in these cells , which had chlorine present at Af .
Data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in Table 1 .
,
If such is the case , the particles within a distance of about Af of the Earth will have , relative to the Earth , a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth .
Even in the neighborhood of the Earth , where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude .
This large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved .
The data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth .
One may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the Earth's orbit .
Many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles , a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities .
Zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket , a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun , as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors .
From an estimated mass of 25 g for a zero-magnitude meteorite , the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in magnitude .
The unshielded flux is given in the last column ; ;
for example , Jacchia ( 1948 ) derived a scale of 0.15 g for a Af , zero-magnitude meteorite .
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites .
It is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development , resulting in the production of BW weapons systems .
Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures .
Very small particles , however , in a size range of 1 to 4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs .
This area is highly susceptible to infection .
The entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation .
Spraying continued along a two-mile course .
They do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives .
This , of course , does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease .
Huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products , drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack .
Abelson and Rawson , using a stepwise elution scheme , fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose .
The red cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use .
The cells were washed three times with saline , anti-human serum was added , the cells were resuspended , and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examined for agglutination .
Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 hr , centrifuged and the serum was removed .
Approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column .
For protein identification , fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5-degrees-C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline .
During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2-degrees-C by surrounding the apparatus with ice .
Because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins , permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure , it was used in all but the earliest experiments .
The strip sections containing a given protein were pooled , eluted with 0.5 ml of isotonic saline , and the eluates were tested for antibody activity .
Ultracentrifugation was then carried out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm for 125 to 150 min , refrigeration being used throughout the run .
Successive 1-ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe , starting at the top of the tube , and tested for agglutinin activity .
Each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers .
some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss .
She also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey .
Then , a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed .
The broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed .
The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host .
Worse still , in a number of cases it has been claimed that the Psithyrus female kills the Bombus queen .
Although Andrena is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together , we must still call it a solitary bee .
Nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the United States west of the Great Plains , for example , in Utah and central Washington .
Additional records of slow growth have been omitted .
Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda .
The African rock python , a close second , is followed in turn by the reticulate python .
The following information on snakes varying greatly in size ( but all with less than a 10-foot maximum ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature .
Beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces .
The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon , a petroleum geologist of the Richmond Oil Company , and reported in 1944 by Emmett R. Dunn .
It is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area .
In this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1 .
Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once .
and , in contrast , are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van Allen and Lindskog , '31 ) .
In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz .
'25 ) .
Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ( Ghoreyeb and Karsner , '13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood ( Comroe , '58 ) .
As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure .
True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present .
Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1 .
Thus , a child's Skeletal Age `` dots '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve .
It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement .
Thus , the alignment of the `` dots '' and `` tips '' , respectively , indicate individual variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls .
When the `` dot '' and `` tip '' coincide , the classification used in this paper is `` Same schedule '' .
The difference between the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in Figures 3 and 4 .
The principles used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix .
It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions for the 34 girls .
his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean .
This iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid , and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems .
There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination , for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin , a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments ( Wolff , Robbins and Rall , 1959 ) .
The presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid .
One of the proteases has pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan , Stanley and Trikojus , 1954 ; ;
The thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream .
There is some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre , particularly in Tasmania and Australia ( Clements and Wishart , 1956 ) .
Dietary influences
In the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia , hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity ( Money , Rall and Rawson , 1952 ; ;
This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin .
Similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping , or organification , or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis .
At the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism TSH acts on the thyroid , but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated , including release of iodine from the thyroid , increase in thyroid weight , increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of Af .
The introduction of the United States Pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the USP and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time .
Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed `` scattered foci of fibrosis '' suggestive of myelofibrosis .
At first the patient felt stronger , and the hemoglobin rose to 13.8 gm. , but on Oct. 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` caving in '' in his knees .
No fasciculations or sensory defects were found .
Muscle weakness did not improve , and the patient needed first a cane , then crutches .
Severe back pain in June , 1959 , prompted a third hospital admission .
A high-protein diet , calcium lactate supplements , and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness .
The body was that of a well-developed , somewhat debilitated white man weighing 108 lb. .
The intimal surface of the aorta was covered with confluent , yellow-brown , hard , friable plaques along its entire course , and there was a marked narrowing of the orifices of the large major visceral arteries .
The lungs weighed together 950 gm. .
Macrophages laden with brown pigment were seen in some of the alveoli , and the intima of some of the small arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue .
The firm red spleen weighed 410 gm. , and its surface was mottled by discrete , small patches of white material .
Purification of the conjugates
As controls , other sections were similarly treated with Af or conjugated antiserum to the New York strain of potato yellow-dwarf virus ( Wolcyrz and Black , 1956 ) .
No antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells .
After Af and Af were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder , nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present .
The concentration and apparent localization of the WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to infect plants .
Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect .
The Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance , but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states , and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions , additional tests seem to be desirable .
This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses .
Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs of pain .
Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation , Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding .
He took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established .
For the interpretation of these significant investigations , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions .
In our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range , we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems , respectively .
If we try to study T using characteristic values , we are confronted with two problems .
This will be more or less our general method for the second problem .
The diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which Af for each i .
The reader will find it helpful to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1 , and even more particularly , to think of the proof of Theorem 10 , a special case of this theorem .
Thus there are polynomials Af such that Af .
This shows that the minimal polynomial for Af divides Af .
It is easily seen that Af divides G .
Let us put Af .
We have just observed that we can write Af where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent , and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials in T .
Since D and D' are both diagonalizable and they commute , they are simultaneously diagonalizable , and Af is diagonalizable .
hence Af and the minimal polynomial is simply x , which says the operator is 0 .
If D denotes the differentiation operator and P is the polynomial Af then V is the null space of the operator p ( , ) , because Af simply says Af .
Then Af .
We devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena , but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models .
More generally , suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials , that each trial results in either a `` success '' or a `` non-success '' ( `` failure '' ) , and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial .
Experiments are often composed of several identical trials , and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated .
Further , an experiment might consist of five rounds , and several sets of five rounds might be regarded as a super-experiment composed of several repetitions of the five-round experiment .
These examples are illustrative of the use of the words `` trial '' and `` experiment '' as they are used in this chapter , but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly .
Example 1 .
On three Fridays the coach has needed a driver .
We now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments .
We also give , for each property , an example where the property is absent .
The language and notation introduced are standard throughout the chapter .
Experimentally , we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another .
The following is a less extreme example of dependence .
Voting for one picture may be called `` success '' , for the other `` failure '' .
But Table 7-1 shows that Af or 0.70 agree , too many for independent voting .
Obviously , very slight changes in P do not change the probabilities much , and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference .
Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success .
Example 2 .
The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Af there are families of such cubes .
On C , from the point P at Af to the point Q at Af , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as S approaches zero the square is inside C .
Suppose Af crosses C when Af .
otherwise , being analytic , they would coincide at all points , which is impossible since they do not coincide near Af .
Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point .
Near Q , both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U .
Therefore , Af is single-valued near Q .
Thus Af is also continuous at Af , and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point .
This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points .
A continuous change in T through an amount E results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve Af .
In the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two-valued or no-valued on one side , and is a single-valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side .
We suppose not .
These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af .
The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T .
Introduction .
1 .
A general line L meets Q in two points , Af and Af , through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus , Af , whose lines are simple secants of Aj .
A final class of exceptional lines is identifiable from the following considerations : Since no two generators of Af can intersect , it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections .
We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described .
Since C is rational , this correspondence has K coincidences , each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image .
For any pencil in a plane containing a Af-fold secant of **zg has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil in Af lines , namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of **zg and the multiple secant , plus an additional component to account for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil .
However , if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely Af .
By holding out prospects for external capital assistance , the United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth .
These countries must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy .
Thus , although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative , and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant , the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange .
Convinced of the wisdom of their own actions , and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs , governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort , becoming instead more rigid and inflexible in their policies .
This condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy , especially in the context of economic aid .
he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; ;
The significant things in it , at the higher religious levels , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation , self-pacification , and self-completion .
Some of the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion .
The common codes , for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior , bind the devotees together .
Religion usually exercises a stabilizing-conserving function .
Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group ; ;
In the family's own words ( during the third of twelve visits ) , they had `` reached the crisis peak -- either the situation will give or we will break '' ! !

As seen in the B. family , there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem , especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance .
The unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled transference .
These needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension .
Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments .
In some programs , treatment is concentrated over a short period of time , while in others , after the initial contact is established , flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success .
Moreover , the shortage of treatment resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available -- and on a more effective basis to more people .
Further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services -- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches -- and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in collaboration with community planners .
The process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements .
There is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power , primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power , has been exerted on actors in the system , particularly in regard to mate selection .
The structural subsystem , consisting of relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts , includes : 1 .
Each family line can be considered a substructure .
To maintain their intermediate position in the larger society , it is not only necessary that members of this population be `` visible '' , but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate , distinct grouping or system in society .
Loomis considers six such processes in his paradigm .
6 .
Urbanization appears to be an important factor in the disintegration of this group .
In such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous , resulting in a change of values and , almost necessarily , in mate selection behavior .
Social control .
By means of this social control , deviance is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group .
There is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society .
It is also expressed in the proscription against deviants in the matter of endogamy , particularly in rural areas .
Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919 .
In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered .
But specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors .
Tribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials .
Each adult is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand .
But it places a severe strain on the administrative resources ( already burdened in other ways ) of a widely dispersed , poor and largely illiterate population .
A number of strong independent agencies , established in some cases with governmental or royal support , have conducted large medical , social , educational and research operations in particular parts of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi .
Other independent , or partially independent agencies , have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to demography .
Field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time African investigators ( three teams , each working in two provinces ) .
In short , scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling .
( 4 ) questions and definitions .
( B ) residents , absent ; ;
The quality of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries .
These area reports will be followed , according to present plans , by a summary report , which will include a detailed statement on methods .
This has subsequently been verified by the experience .
( 2 ) Auditors were encouraged .
After that , we began to get `` visitors '' to class .
It ranged from those with no children , through students in various stages of pregnancy , to one 44-year-old male with four children , three of whom were teenagers .
For example , the steering committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched .
From a few students this group gradually increased to include over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class , and many outsiders as well .
Whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction , the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest .
From here they proceeded to ( 3 ) These same areas in relation to their own future family life stages , developing these to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to confront them at some time or other .
This added a personal zest to class discussions and participation .
There was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented , from a childless couple to and including every trimester .
Guilford-Martin ; ;
One subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax .
There was no implication made that their initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) was less preferred than the presence of levitation .
The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control .
She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial , but had consciously prevented it from so doing .
but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation .
Thus , this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor .
Yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be .
It might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong ; ;
Reliability and validation work with the Children's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda , et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale .
Results
While we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives .
As predicted , the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly ( Af ) than those in the structured schools .
The interaction effect , which is significant at the level , can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores .
As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements .
Apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked .
The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business .
In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area , since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning .
Entirely concerned with efficiency , he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes , condemning them to too great an extent .
He admitted his behavior , and defended it .
or we may say that his attitude was commendable , showing his independence of mind , in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others .
He was told he displayed , for example , a sense of superiority -- and he answered : `` Well , I am supposed to know all the answers , aren't I '' ? ?
In short , as frequently happens in analyses , the individual feels threatened and defends himself .
These errors were then collected and written on a blackboard , condensing similar ideas .
This behavior is more `` veridical '' -- or true -- than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation , and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning .
Earlier , this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times , when she was in her room alone , it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room , as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice .
The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. .
The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file .
A random-storage scheme , based on the spelling of forms , provides an economical way to compile this text-form list .
Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked .
dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text .
Let Af denote the form of Af .
The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms .
The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text .
This selection-rejection process takes place as the file is read .
( The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage .
Is George put the cat out , dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement , the cat , not the second complement out .
Is George reads the news emotionally , dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally .
In I'll go with George dominant stress is probably on George ; ;
Often , dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion .
In is she Chinese or Japanese ? ?
In hunger stimulates man too the situation is very similar .
Thus to has light stress both in that was the conclusion that I came to and in that was the conclusion I came to .
It is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written .
But it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics .
Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems , we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis .
Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use .
Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system .
The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse function of the size -- smaller systems are more troublesome -- for any given degree of morphophonemic complexity .
This hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis , as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems .
Most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies .
But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of Igbo phonology .
Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems .
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier ; ;
) These general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison .
These differences in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning between illiterate informants and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area , but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined .
I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley .
Other classes are included only by myself ( interrogatives , adverbs ) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer ( pronouns , demonstratives ) .
What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes : ( 1 ) body parts and products , which with a proportionally nearly even representation ( 51 terms out of 253 , 25 out of 100 ) come out with nearly even ratios ; ;
Hoijer's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings ( with allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly , big-large , long-far , many-much , die-dead , say-speak ) .
the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively Af ; ;
The actual mean of 1.07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement .
In 1960 , David D. Thomas published Basic Vocabulary In some Mon-Khmer Languages ( AL 2 , No. 3 , pp. 7 - 11 ) , which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate ( Af ) in place of original ( Af ) , and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in Towards Greater Accuracy ( IJAL 21 : :

The most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible .
and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities .
He has traversed provinces and kingdoms , but he has not consolidated them behind him , nor does he control them .
At Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans who would have to leave , trying to find work in Germany , and Roosevelt objected to the Western Neisse River being chosen in the south , instead of the Eastern Neisse , both of which flow into the Oder .
Of more importance to the West than Poland's boundaries was the character of her government .

Preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes .
The second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration , nomination and voting .
They were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new , constructive national effort .
To minimize the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government was formed .
From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results .
The newer party campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years .
The Chamber of Commerce elections were , of course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections .
The registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit of a reliable census .
In addition , many large corporations operate their own formal training programs .
In Illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs , and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent .
Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities , staff and program are in being .
The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant .
There is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs , even though they must pay tuition , receive no subsistence payments , and are not guaranteed a job .
Such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries , where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located .
The very idea of there being `` count rules '' implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway ( run up or run down ) movement .
The foregoing have been methods of charting prices , but now let us look at some of the other indices that are customarily charted , and which are looked to for their forecasting abilities .
The search for forecasting formulae is ceaseless .
It recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth , a quest heavily invested in , during the days of wooden ships .
There sit men who make moving averages of weekly volume , monthly averages of price-earnings ratios , ratios of the number of advances to the number of declines , ratios of an individual stock's performance to overall market performance , ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume , odd-lot indices , and what not .
All these things and countless more enter into their calculations , and yet , the enchanting index remains non-forthcoming .
We mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago .
This warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top .
And while all concerned are members of the literal public , somewhat less than all concerned , although still a majority , form the quotation marked `` public '' .
Certain badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair , dirty , or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces .
The study of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow , what with all observers trying to get on the side of the `` few '' at the same time .
The usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis as well , declines in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use .
Mr. Alexander H. Wheelan's Study Helps In Point And Figure Technique tells the readers : `` We assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the securities and commodities markets '' .
What with traders trading for so many different objectives , and what with there being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading techniques in use , and more coming into use all the time , it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough `` fans '' to invalidate itself .
In the final analysis , then , the user becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance , notwithstanding any amount of forethought and calculation , however elaborate .
Chapter 6 , more methods
At this time , however , there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction .
The recovery will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit , as well as by an expansion of Government spending , well sustained consumer spending , and some rebuilding of business inventories .
Slight downward pressure
What does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in 1961 ? ?
However , to the extent that the monetary authorities , in their effort to ease credit in the next several months , conduct their open market operations in longer-term Government bonds , they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces .
Here would be a powerful force for raising business activity .
It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play , the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the Fifties .
The huge backlog of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the War was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the War , and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields .
For expository purposes , this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages .
The Mathematical Appendix presents the rigorous argument , but is best read after Part 1 , in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit .
A .
Price competition is lacking .
B .
Finally , since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies , larger wage increases call for less than proportionately larger price increases ( e.g. , if a wage increase of 5% allows a price increase of 7% , a wage increase of 10% allows a price increase of something less than 14% ) .
The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase in the basic wage rate .
We assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate increases , and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the `` real '' wage rate .
In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise .
From this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model .
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow .
They must do something with the acquiescence of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction '' .
During the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the Latin American writers , though ineffectively , just as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them , with more effect , today .
his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action .
A state , the highest form of human organization in fact and theory , could be subjected to Law only by a manifestation of self-will , or consent .
In this view , supported by only three members of the Court , a power denied by the specific provisions of Article 3 , was granted by the generality of Article 1 .
One purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil War amendments against state interference .
Such legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter .
But it is crucial that here , unlike Burford , the trial court was ordered to retain the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the state-law question .
refusal to adjudicate is another .
The railroad , claiming deprivation of property without due process of law , sought injunctive relief .
The Justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that Congress' purpose was merely to make unions suable .
He will not be `` fooled by technicalities '' .
The result , of course , would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states .
Here , as in the Byrd case , another element of state procedure was subsumed to federal judge-made law .
Another problem in the area of federal-state relationships is this : what constitutes reversible error in a state decision ? ?
furthermore , Congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states .
The Court , nevertheless , relied on the Seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders of the two corporations were the same .
Revenue Ruling 54-17 provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation , a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax , followed by the name of the successor corporation .
The Ruling would not , however , apply to an acquisition of assets for cash .

The research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of Washington might not be typical of those throughout the country , or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made .
The objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs .
There was further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive .
By these steps the final AIA list was reduced from 8,000 to 3,500 .

Processing the returns
The second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the AIA list with those from companies on the TR list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study .
For a number of years , there have been sporadic attempts in California to organize farm workers .
They were inadequately financed , without experienced leadership , and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole .
As a result of these changed conditions , the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations has been much greater than in the past .
Normally , because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance , we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the Unemployment Insurance Code , although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility .
It permits referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute , provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute .
A similar case arose at the Bowers ranch in Butte County , and the Superior Court of that county issued similar restraining orders .
First , let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved .
Further , and as an evidence of legislative intent only , the Senate of the United States recently defeated by a substantial majority the `` Holland Amendment '' to the Fair Labor Standards Act , which would have specifically limited the regulatory authority of the Secretary in these matters .
The public interest is so dominant in such an issue that I cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two Superior Courts in the State .
None has yet arisen under condition ( 2 ) , relating to referral to jobs `` the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute '' .
Here the problem is essentially one of defining the word `` filling '' .
How a child feels about himself , about other people , and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics .
Studies of the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects , noises , falling , and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years , but that fears of the dark , of being alone , and of imaginary creatures or robbers increase .
Children need help in learning to control their emotions .
the older child learns that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers , and , therefore , makes a real effort to control his emotions .
those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activities more than do well-adjusted children .
Studies conducted in various sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally , and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects .
These maladjustments in turn inhibit learning , and a vicious cycle is completed .
The causes of retardation and maladjustment may be found in physical factors , such as defective speech or hearing , impaired vision , faulty motor coordination , a frail constitution , chronic disease , malnutrition , and glandular malfunctioning .

that on the immediate horizon , if further large-scale ( relatively speaking ) desegregation comes , it will result from court orders on suits filed in several Middle-South states .
The large acreage in the Southwest Redevelopment area beckons white people -- what with high-priced town houses and elevator apartments .
First , how can we step up the desegregation movement ? ?
Shall we support pupil assignment ? ?
This question is an issue because it likely divides us into two camps -- those for or against pupil assignment .
Issue no. 2 .
Is the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement ? ?
Or is this subject a matter of self-determination , a matter of states rights or county rights ? ?
Nearly half the children still receive no education .
In situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education .
There have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy .
If this happens , there may be some class conflict in the South , with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position .
One social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families .
that is , they are likely to favor a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value .
Furthermore , the Commission set up the Council for Financial Aid to Education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education .
These people are practically always upper- or upper-middle-class persons , who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society .
They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society .
During the past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities , state colleges , and community colleges .
There remains a residue of total costs , or total `` revenue requirements '' which , since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density , is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis .
and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination .
This `` grand division '' permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class , such as street lighting , or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes .
For the reason just suggested , I shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example .
per kilowatt-hour , and a $2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 per kilowatt -- a total bill of $8 for that month .
These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless , or almost regardless , of power consumption .

It has surrendered any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness , as in Heidegger's system ( 1929 ) .
Science is mocked for wishing to know nothing of Nothing , in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense of men .
Likewise , Kant formulated the nebular hypothesis , according to which the solar system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas , nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by Laplace in his Systeme Du Monde .
By clarifying fundamental premises in the social sciences , and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands of each new scientific discipline , philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding .
The hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument ; ;
for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science .
The tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science , religion and ideology .
Philosophic systems , by the very nature of their completeness , are overthrown by rival systems .
When dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge , or better the role of philosophy in assisting research on the social sources of ideas , one has to become necessarily selective .
The objection will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted , namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in the social sciences .
Does society really exist as an entity over and above the agglomeration of men ? ?
Such pseudo-questions assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving undefined universals .
Social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions , than physics has the right to expect a theological solution to the wave-particle controversy .
Now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows .
Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered .
On the positivist theory , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second .
In the only sense in which badness is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety , since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling , and that feeling is still there .
If anyone asked us , after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference in the world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing left to be bad , and that our assertion was in that case mistaken .
On the theory before us , such relief would be groundless , for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all , and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about .
And there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself .
The pain in itself was neutral ; ;
We shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation .
then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand .

But by the tracing procedure , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner , find the unseen form ; ;
After a conversation with another man , he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like .
Then he might finally recognize it , apparently by combining the visual blot , actually being seen , with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements .

The Providence Daily Post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings .

Rather than being deceived , the eye is puzzled ; ;
These areas , by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern , stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued -- and set to shuttling again -- only by conventional perspective ; ;
) By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness , the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done .
For the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief , which gives way in turn , and with equal immediacy , to an illusion that seems to contain both -- or neither .
Because of the size of the areas it covers , the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily , as more than an indication or sign .
The area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material -- or simply of a painted-in form -- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth .
All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it .
and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method , the subject itself became largely unrecognizable .
) But the inner , formal logic of Cubism , as it worked itself out through the collage , had just as much to do with shaping their decision .
It was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason -- that is , because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape -- that the identity of depicted objects , or at least parts of them , re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there -- but only as flattened silhouettes -- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 .

For all these points he relies exclusively on Berle and Means's study of 1932 , The Modern Corporation And Private Property .

The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which recognizes unconscious motivations , and which rests on certain ethical absolutes , empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is urging at the moment .
This sort of manipulation is especially troublesome in Fromm's work because , although his system is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions , he asserts that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own consulting room .

so that , while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy , it is difficult to date one .
There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about Hardy's development : he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his .
He had two productive periods , one in the late 1860's , the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920 ( half of the dated poems are from the latter period , and these alone total about one-tenth of all Hardy's poems ) .
The first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a vocation , before he had decided to write fiction for a living ( in his note for Who's Who he wrote that he `` wrote verses 1865 - 1868 ; ;
The second productive period , the decade from 1910 to 1920 , can be related to three events : the completion of The Dynasts in 1909 , which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years ; ;
It may seem strange that a poet should come to full fruition in his seventies , but we have it on Hardy's own authority that `` he was a child till he was sixteen , a youth till he was five-and-twenty , and a young man till he was nearly fifty '' ( Early Life , p. 42 ) .
We may carry this sequence one step further and say that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers , wanting only the impetus of two tragedies , one personal , the other national , to loose those powers in poetry .
The details of the setting of `` Neutral Tones '' are not , strictly speaking , metaphorical , but they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love , and in this way love and weather , the emotions and the elements , symbolize each other in a way that is common to many of Hardy's best poems ( `` Weathers '' , `` The Darkling Thrush '' , and `` During Wind and Rain '' , for example ) and to some moving passages in the novels as well ( Far From The Madding Crowd is full of scenes constructed in this way ) .
if it is somber , it is also precise , and the precision lends authority to the vision .
he sometimes called them `` an expiation '' , and he would not allow them to be published in periodicals .
The poems are , the epigraph tells us , the `` traces of an ancient flame '' ; ;
So as the years passed , I saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration .
Being with him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones .
They were both very fluent .
Horace's column of imperishable verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of Augustan Rome .
The tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries .
It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas did to poetry .
The special syntactical effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith Sitwell -- actually ornaments -- become the main concern .
Thomas's ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves .
He may have been eccentric in his behavior , but his paintings are as impassive as Persian tiles .
Confabulation has come to determine structure .
In fact , once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall , it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper .
So , in the last couple of years , abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion -- indications of landscape or living figures .
This observation is of interest not only to students of Homeric poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well .
Words or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable time-servers , sometimes accurate and sometimes not .
If the master of scops who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional , he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements .
True , we do not know how they were regarded in their day , but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases .
in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus , and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation .
at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed .
Anglo-Saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition ; ;
Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in Great Expectations , as in no other of Dickens' novels , hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme -- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them .
Held upside down in the graveyard , Pip clings in terror `` with both hands '' to his convict ; ;
Orlick shakes his hand at Pip , bangs the table with his fist , draws his unclenched hand `` across his mouth as if his mouth watered '' for his victim , lets his hands hang `` loose and heavy at his sides '' , and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows `` of the slightest action of his fingers '' .
A variety of hand movements helps dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world Pip encounters beyond the forge .
Additional restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions appear on page 106 .
Reservation of index words and electronic switches
This table originally indicates that index words 1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for assignment to symbolic references ; ;
Otherwise , symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words .
The preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized or multi-phase program , particularly when used in conjunction with the LITORIGIN statement .
Autocoder declarative statements provide the processor with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations properly .
Declarative statements are never executed in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area , placed preferably at its beginning or end .
An individual switch or the entire set of switches in a word may be tested or altered as desired .
The area may include constant information supplied by the programmer .
The entry DIOCS must be written exactly as shown .
When an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified , Autocoder will equate IOCSIXG to it .
Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen / hr. / hp.
O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes .
At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities .
Examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the 6-hr. composite samples with 24-hr. operations .
The data indicated that the organic load during the 6-hr. composites was essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr. organic load .
Pilot plant operations
The flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table 1 .
With the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open sewers .
This low BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study .
The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29 , 1961 .
An extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water .
The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0-mg. / l. dissolved oxygen concentration and 10-degrees-C for various rotor speeds is given in Table 3 .
The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent , indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface .
The major postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting .
Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective .
Russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world , divided between her various fleets .
Its speed has increased , it operates at increasingly greater depths , its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited , and it will become even more silent .
Therefore , the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent .
Shipbuilding , aircraft procurement , and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything .
Therefore , any measures taken in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when hostilities occur .
what was new yesterday is obsolescent today .
Supporting elements in asw operations
To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated , the mission has been stated , broad principles delineating its content laid down , and the supporting elements listed .
Before considering these elements in more detail , an additional requirement should be stated .
Therefore , improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and , as it supports all other elements , rates a top priority .
Gathering intelligence is important , but of equal importance is its translation into usable form .
Progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging , but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information .
In an over-all ASW concept , dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with proven capabilities .
Fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems .
The submarine has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system .

-- Recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions of polymeric chains by Volkenstein and Lifson has been extended to include more general types of chains .
-- The crystallization of copolymers comprising Af units interspersed with a minor percentage of Af is limited by the inability of the crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky side group of the latter .

Insect infestation is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain .
In this respect , the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized foods has , to date , been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods .
A number of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and palatability , however , at dosages substantially less than sterilization levels .
Of the various particle accelerators , the Van De Graff machines , resonant transformers , and linear accelerators are the principal ones available for commercial use .
Thus , food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability .
However , the problem of consumer acceptability remains .
Under the conditions of comparison , it will be noted that : ( 1 )
The force required to accomplish removal is plotted , by means of an electronic recorder , against distance of removal .
The instrumental method , however , is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time .
It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure .
Af is the normal compressive force acting on the shear plane ; ;
If the cutting force , Af , is plotted against film thickness , a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope Af .
The curvature of this bluntness is , in the case of the Carboloy knife employed in the Hesiometer , determined by the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mil. .
This reduces to the relationship : Af , where Af is the intercept at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn. ( 1 ) , Af is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife tip , Af is a straight line first approximation of this roundness , and the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn. ( 1 ) .
Softer knives would blunt very rapidly , making the value of Af inexact .
In extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even change during the course of a measurement .
Eventually , rupture occurs along the shear plane ( 9e ) , and the cycle repeats itself .
On the following pages , each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail , as to properties , applications , and methods of processing .
Present estimates are that production topped the 100-million-lb. mark in 1960 ( 85 to 90 million lb. for flexible , 10 or 11 million lb. for rigid ) ; ;
Properties
Most commercial uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lb. / cu. ft. for rigid foams , between 1 and 3 lb. / cu. ft. for flexible foams .
Flexural strength :
This term refers to the ability of a material to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by bending .
This property refers to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart .
Processing urethanes
The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape , it can be molded , it can be poured-in-place , it can be applied by spray guns , etc. .
The ingredients are fed from tanks through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate .
Simple systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured , pumped , etc. , into a void where they foam up to fill the void .
Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-F ( 29 - 32-degrees-C ) .
Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate .
Suggested evaluation and classification
A reflectance-measuring instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning , whereas Soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal .
Four washing test procedures are established , varying in severity from very severe to very mild , and are intended to cover the range of practical washing from commercial procedure to hand washing .
It is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code consisting of a Roman Numeral , a letter , and an Arabic number .
Principle
wash wheel -- cylindrical wash wheel of the reversing type .
The wheel ( cage ) is 20 to 24 inches inside diameter and 20 to 24 inches inside length .
One fin is located every 120-degrees around the inside diameter of the wheel .
The machine is equipped with a pipe for injecting live steam that is capable of raising the temperature of water at an eight-inch level from 110-degrees to 140-degrees-F ( 38*0 to 60*0C. ) in less than two minutes .
Dryer -- dryer of the rotary tumble type , having a cylindrical basket approximately 30 inches in diameter and 24 inches in length and rotating at approximately 35 r.p.m. .
measuring scale --
Each pin is individually sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in the slot .
Woven fabrics to be dried by procedure b ( flat-bed pressed ) or restored by procedure 3 ( hand ironing ) :
Woven or warp knitted fabrics to be subjected to restorative procedure 1 ( tension presser ) .
Critical measurements in length and width directions should be taken before and after washing , drying , and restorative procedures .
When this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature is that shown in Column Aj .
Image intensifier based upon the `` multipactor '' principle , ( D )
Transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifiers ( TSEM tubes ) , ( E )
Cascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely .
However , electrostatic focus , important for many applications , has not been realized for these devices .
Cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution .
These tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members .
The anode potential codetermines the gain , G , and magnification , M , of the stage .
As it will be shown later , the field-flattening properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design .
The luminous flux gain of a single stage is given by : Af .
This value may be reduced to 4.6 percent by means of a ( very thin ) glass layer of index 1.5 .
Since we are considering here relatively small diameter ( 1 - 1.5 inches ) fiber plates , their average thickness can be kept below 1/4 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent ( per plate ) .
The efficiency Af of an Af lens at the magnification Af is : Af .
We have evaluated the `` matching integrals '' for two types of photocathodes ( S-11 and S-20 ) and three types of light input .
Theoretical discussion of paraxial device resolution
Thus , in general , elementary light optical effects , light scatter , and electron scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit .
( 3 )
He recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an R-stage process , the remaining stages must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage , if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process .
To see how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables ; ;
But Af is vastly larger than R .
Then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennia ! !
This is the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation .
Each stage transforms the state Af of its feed to the state Af in a way that depends on the operating variables Af .
Here P represents the value of the stream in state P and Q the cost of operating the stage with conditions Q .
Hence P is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation , that is , the net profit .
The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only statistically is also of interest , although for chemical reactor design it is not as important as the deterministic process .
The word distance is used here in a rather general sense ; ;
Thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the **yf axis , the system can be rotated with an angular velocity Af if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis Aj .
The voltage Af is amplified by Af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor Af .
There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts , engine noise , turbulence around the vehicle , etc. .
The amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level .
Below this level , the amplifier gain Af is proportional and is of small value , in order to provide adequate noise filtering .
The effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level , at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process .
Manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs .
7-5 .
A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north .
This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques .
This instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading .
Figure 7-3 shows a platform system with the gyro vectors arranged as described above .
The earth is spinning at an angular velocity **zq equal to one revolution per 24 hr. .
Rachel was polite , Scotty indifferent .
She would hover over him and , looking like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty's fork or spoon .
Try to get that down '' .
if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words in the same way , without emphasis or impatience , only a little louder .
She was with Elizabeth .
They turned at the bottom of Kate's steps and moved off in the direction of the park .
his delicate hand , as veined as a moth's wing , rested absently on Scotty's chest .
She did not touch him .
She said , `` Do you think you'll miss school '' ? ?
He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown .
it floated up the stairs .
`` Is his appetite improved '' ? ?
Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat .
He looked at the lined face with vague interest ; ;
He hadn't even seen him yet
Mines .

He could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position .
On their right rose the embankment covered with brush and trees .
The warped , broken trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes .
Warren handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the line .
Even so , he could not ease the tension of his body ; ;
They were poems in a strange language , of which he could barely touch a meaning -- enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there .
Pierre had no hands ; ;

The nude was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise '' .
She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too much and didn't own the mint .
She was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash , and Mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury .
This is why he made such a magnificent soldier .
You could hear them from our outpost .
Jane asked in her placid , interested way .
More of this stamping down of human emotion as a young lawyer in New York .
perhaps it was just .
The Vice President had called and asked if he could see the Secretary at his home .
The Secretary was uneasy about the visit .
He observed the Florentine vase in the hall , the Renoir painting in the library , as well as the long shelves of well-bound volumes ; ;
Where will you break ? ?
How best to destroy your peace ? ?
I've got a quarter of a million Germans in my state , and those krautheads tune in on Father Werther every night , and if he tells them to go out and piss in the public square , that's what they do .
And another one comes to me and he says , ' Look here , there's a mill in my state employs five thousand people making uniforms for the Navy .
The Bishop looked at him coldly and said , `` Take it or leave it '' ! !

To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience , something for which they lived from week to week .
It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday night prayer meeting .
The school was small , dark and ill-equipped .
The very proposition was sacrilege .
It was going to stay forever .
It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject .
Two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow .
The idea had come from Herold , who had once been a chemist's clerk .
He explained his errand , but without bothering much to make it plausible , for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army .
He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped .
Still , the sensation always surprised him .
It was a thrill he felt no part in .
He stopped and whispered his errand .
He smiled , but now that he knew where the elder Seward was , he did not intend to go .
He got caught up into it and became a different person .
Only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle over it for days , whereas at the time it had seemed quite real .
It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more .
On a stage he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause , he must be doing it better than usual .
That was one of the high spots of the play .
Most of them had seen Our American Cousin before , and unless Miss Keene was on stage , there was not much to it .
There was no mistaking that scream .
It was not exactly panic they gave way to , but they could not just sit there .
He went straight to the Presidential box .
Stevie twisted and , frantically , commanded the mare to leap straight ahead .
Katie reared a third time , then , trembling , descended .
They rode around and around to trample the figure into the sand .
his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt .
The Dutch Reformed Church , with two steeples and its own school was on Main Street ; ;

The stern face would relax , the black-clad arms would embrace him , `` My son '' ! !
It would summon him once ; ;
A flash illumined the trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions .
He shouted , and was aghast at the echoes .
`` Don't you be afraid , Violet '' ! !
Ludie did as he pleased .
He came home overheated , ran straight to the ice-chest , and gulped shivery cold water .
That Ludie ! !
It's those two fucken niggers ! !
If only the fucken weather wasn't so lousy ! !
`` I soon came back to my senses '' , he said , aloud , to the young blizzard , proudly , drawing himself up , as if making a report to some important superior .
Maybe they'll stop it now , once for all .
Keerist .
It always came on , faithfully , just like a radio or juke box , whenever he started to worry too much about something , when the bad things tried to push their way into him .
It was a word he was proud of , a word that meant much to him , and he used it with great pleasure , almost as if it were an exclusive possession , and more : he sensed himself to be very highly educated , four cuts above any of the folks back home .

He rolled over and tried to shut out the noise , now much louder .
He refuses to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher institution .
Immediately after dinner , however , Rousseau asks for still another favor .
This time as a musician .
Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it , Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera .
And for good reasons .
`` Put a few such songs together '' , they urged him .
But no .
A contradiction ? ?
`` What was your answer '' ? ?
`` What else could I do ? ?
And that was why , on the day of the performance , when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace , he did not bother to shave .
They pointed out to him .
`` But in such a slovenly condition '' .
Surely it would grow there whether I washed myself or not .
Here , before the court ? ?
I must state that the faster things happened , the slower they happened ; ;
My Cousin Simmons carried a musket , but he had loaded it with bird shot , and as the officer came opposite him , he rose up behind the wall and fired .
I would have stood there and died there if left to myself , but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there ; ;
Mattathias Dover said :
Dancing was no longer permitted in the streets .
There were several on the Council who tried to live like Christians .
He brushed back his black hair , shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes .
Loneliness tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of Peter Robert , Nerien , Nicholas Cop , Martin Bucer , and even the compromising Louis Du Tillet .
Libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded : `` Are we going to allow the Protestant Pope , Master Calvin , to curtail our liberty ? ?
Why , oh why , doesn't he stick to preaching the Gospel , instead of meddling in civic affairs , politics , economics , and social issues that are no concern of the Church '' ? ?
`` You are to be accused of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal '' .
`` What was your reply to that '' ? ?
He wanted to run , but he knew that if he did , he would be lost .
The chinless Jake called .
Or was he now taking the role -- the gesture and the suffering -- because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid , befogged loneliness of this land .
In that moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying : I must not hate him , I must not hate him or I shall die .
Lemme tell you now '' --
The drizzle was slacking off now , but the light was grayer .
Into the emptiness of the street , and his spirit , moved a form .
The form was swathed in an army blanket , much patched , fastened at the neck with a cord .
Her name was Mollie .
Those men , lying in the huts , they did not know .
He thought : Only in my heart can I make the world hang together .
`` Gre't big fat chicken , yeah '' .
Mose giggled .
`` Fooled you , huh ? ?
It is salt po'k .
That po'k , it was so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say , hoo-pig .
He seemed to be muttering , his voice surprisingly clear .
Laura touched his hand .
The night before , they had telephoned the Andrus maid , Selena Masters , and she had arrived early , bursting her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley and confounded Moll .
After she had served the detectives coffee and toast ( they politely declined eggs , uncomfortable about their tenancy ) , she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock market quotations .
She answered him precisely , missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports .
McFeeley greeted the parents , then studied his notebook .
Sipping their coffee , discussing the weather , the day's shopping , Fritzie's commitments at the network ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio , the morning TV news show , even the front page of the Santa Luisa Register , resting on the kitchen bar .
Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors .
He did not want to bring the Andruses to the station house too early -- Rheinholdt had summoned a press conference , and he didn't want them subjected to the reporters again .
He did not see Sparling , or DeGroot , or Ringel , or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago .
McFeeley identified himself .
It was amazing how they had herded together for protection : an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper , rising from the breakfast table ; ;
`` Funny thing '' , Mr. Kahler said , when they were seated , `` when I heard you ringing , I figured it was that guy down the block , Hausman '' .
Both grinned at the detective .
She was intimidated by the stove .
The gas flamed up two inches high .
Before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them .
`` Sabine called a few minutes ago '' , Eugene said .
Mme Vienot , considerably younger and very different .
The curtains were of the same material , and there were some big oil paintings -- portraits in the style of Lancret and Boucher .
Looking around slowly , he saw a marble fireplace , a desk , a low bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass panes in the doors .
Da-da-da-dum Music could not be Eugene's passion .
He moved over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything .
He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said : `` Now what do we do '' ? ?
They looked , even so .
They had lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad , busy , unpicturesque streets , and coming home they got lost in the Metro ; ;
it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed , in order to take the line that went to the Place Redoute .
`` Well , this is France , after all '' .
They were damp .
But where do people go swimming in Paris ? ?
`` All because I didn't feel like dancing '' .
The tweed coat , maybe .
His first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe .
They would feel what Mary was undergoing .
Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; ;
Discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes , he began a study of the anatomy of folds .
Michelangelo grinned .
`` Not at all .
I wish to make Jesus an authentic Jew .
`` Workmen .
His first model arrived at dusk .
The model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy ; ;
Though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision , he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties , old , wrinkled , broken in body and face by labor or worry .
On Sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses .
At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli .
The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons .
Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps .
Few of the neighbors came , but Mrs. Tussle came , called by tragedy .
Stranger , Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle , drunkenly singing `` Old Dan Tucker '' at the top of his voice .
Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road , Kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house , cold sober .
Kate drew more and more on her affection for Joel through the hot days of summer work .
She had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer , after she saw Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom .
Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate's baby and at Jonathan's decision to go with the South `` And , dear Kate '' , she wrote , `` poor Dr. Breckenridge's son Robert is now organizing a militia company to go South , to his good father's sorrow .
Rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley .
He has notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the Army of the Potomac .
I am to go to Washington to serve with him '' .
`` Tomorrow .
And this handsome booby , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom ? ?
David Cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh .
A mist was walking on the water , white as cotton , but with a blending and merging grace .
A strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes .
-- flapped as it ran .
The ungainly bird thing ran away , and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster .
Chapter 10
The news of battle on Breed's Hill had already seeped through , and New York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress .
The chevaux de frise , those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the Battery , pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in .
Today , tomorrow , six months , even perhaps a year
From the saddlebags , hung on a Hitchcock chair , David took out a good English razor , a present from John Hunter .
There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war .
David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface .
He was proud that he had never worn a wig .
he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much .
He wondered how they could go on in poverty , superstition , ignorance , with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish .
He had sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists .
We all seek the same thing through different ways -- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over Zion '' .
This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism .
In his heart he had no desire to go to Palestine .
He ground his teeth together .
Only Palestine , and I will never live to see Palestine because I did not believe .
He and Ana watched it carefully .
Lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere .
The Death's-Head Corps took in Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries , and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken , dope-ridden maniacs .
`` I'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin '' .
Not a bad girl .
I hated you when I first came in .
`` Since the war I have seen the way the Germans have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds of years .
Why do we let the Germans do this '' ? ?
I've lost faith , Styka .
But now I think I hate it very much '' .
Grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center .
Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl .
`` I am '' , she said .
I was crazy about her all over again .
What about him '' ? ?
If he pokes his nose in here I'll slug him '' .
I'm not a plaster saint .
Waking up was horrible .
She lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot .
Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight .
Oval face without an expression in the world .
Exboyfriend meet exhusband '' .
First thing I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers .
I didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone .
Of course I had to give her Eileen's address , but she never came near us .
All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever .
I use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship .
To be on the safe side I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night .
Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet .
I never could find out what his business was .
Occasionally if I pushed him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his .
We still had that much in common .
The trouble was drinking cost money .
I don't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer hadn't come to town .
Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything .
All evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion .
For once radicalism was a recommendation .
No matter how devoted a man was , no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord , he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual .
All of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the Lord , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the Lord's servants .
Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it , not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church -- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career -- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel .
`` I guess it will be all right .
`` No , only fourteen .
He said .
He went on to explain what he had in mind .
She could act and she could write .
There we shall be free and unknown ; ;
we can return the following morning
And he would see her that evening .
At their meeting he told her not to bother about `` where '' -- he would attend to that .
She sang him Scott's charming ballad `` Rosabelle '' , which was the vogue of the moment .
Each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation .
`` What about the bedroom '' ? ?
Claire felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan .
`` Sex is overpriced '' , he said .
He drew her close and , hand on cheek , turned her face to his .
Demanded Mary .
William , he was called , in honor of the man who was at once Shelley's pensioner and his most bitter detractor .
With a pardonable irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter :
`` A public of one '' , Mary echoed reprovingly .
`` There are other Mr. Thynnes .
He glanced back .
The officer , surprised , said he would have to see .
He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof , but the soldier had followed him .
Watson snorted and then laughed aloud .
Exactly ! !
They crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats .
He had reached the three passive guards ; ;
He felt a spectator interest .
The figure halted , and Watson gasped .
He reached down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm .
-- Henry said that he'd take my arm and get me right there .
Watson paused for breath .
Watson turned away , sickened for the first time in many months .
The men mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away .
What do you do to them ? ?
No , nor later .
To confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu , gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go ? ?
Watson spat on the ground .
Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering .
It would have been like her .
Mrs. Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer .
He was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the Blevins' , thinking that they might give him a drink .
their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door .
`` Your wife just called '' , she said , separating one word from another , exactly like a child .
Won't you step into the living room , where it's cozier '' ? ?
A fire had just been lighted , he saw , and things had been set out for drinks , and , like any stray , his response to these comforts was instantaneous .
The thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness .
In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves .
And the stiffly regal look of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver of age which , thwarting the efforts of her amazing will , ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string .
To Mark : `` Please give my regards to Myra '' .
I hope Raphael bought them whole '' .
Then she looked at the old woman again , her eyes calm .
There's no greater catastrophe in the universe , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans on the silver fork , than the dwindling away of a family .
It seemed to her , as it seemed each night , that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs , giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows .
`` She didn't mention bringing Myra '' , Mark said , maneuvering the car into the next lane .
I feel kind of bad about it '' .
Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation .
He turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye again the great fieldstone house which , built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor , had been Izaak's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended .
'' Mark asked , and Abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road , the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down .
He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast up and gently turning , its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky .
Meeting it without preparation as they did , robbed of anticipation , a common disappointment seized them .
I shook him a little harder and made some noise .
I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough .
He's got him in the kitchen '' .
`` Pedersen '' ? ?
It's the Pedersen kid .
Hans found him froze .
You know I don't want to see Pedersen .
Pedersen .
He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep .
`` Yeah '' .
`` Don't be smart .
You want the kid to die ? ?
Do you ? ?
`` Pa don't care about the kid '' .
All he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face .
Nothing .
I was ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down .
It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides .
`` I'll get more snow '' , I said .
I took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch .
but since she didn't know we'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back .
But now Ma .
He took pride in his hiding .
`` Hold his head up '' .
Stowey Rummel was internationally famous , a crafter of a genuine Americana in foreign eyes , an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality .
Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved .
He had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked , and good humor ; ;
She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp .
She called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure .
She enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house , was the realest part of life .
Now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey would let them out one of the doors ; ;
improvise cha-chas on the harp ; ;
People died , she would have said , in hospitals , or in cars on the highway at night .
When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs , she would go to the Big House .
There was much embracing , much exclaiming .
`` We were on our vacation in Canada '' , Howard explained , in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming , `` and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home .
We didn't expect him to come along ; ;
Bobby Joe was thinking about something else .
Driving along the caliche-topped road to town , Howard talked .
She exclaimed .
Bobby Joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting , and Uncle Bill Farnworth ( from Mama Albright's side of the family ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then .
Linda Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable .
He stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks , he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention , he quacked with the ducks , and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese .
The purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again , the hen , with whom some sort of communication had been set up , nestling in the doctor's arms .
They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe ; ;
unwarranted they were in any case for , as he stood facing the fille de chambre , his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room .
Alex returned to the hotel , rather weary and with no new prospects of a role , in the late afternoon , but found the doctor in an ebullient mood .
`` Here '' , Winston said gently , `` what's these dishes doing not washed '' ? ?
`` Leave me alone '' , Leona said .
`` This is moving day '' , Winston reminded her , `` and I bet you left things every which way upstairs , your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made .
His eye had fastened on her leg ; ;
`` Fuss , fuss , old man '' .
He drew back , embarrassed and pleased .
Said you wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms '' .
He hardly believed his reason himself any more .
He had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat , and his brief case lay on the bench .
That house was ten years off his life let himself .
Still , he had liked the way she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton dress -- citron yellow , if he remembered .
She had had a dignity about her , even barefoot and almost too tan .
In a week the hyacinths would spike out .
And the dogwood in early May , for Miss Ada's alfresco party ; ;
Winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall .
The alabaster cockatoo '' .
Winston followed her around the room , collecting the small frail objects ( Christmas , birthday , and anniversary ) and wrapping them in tissue paper .
When they came to Mr. Jack's photograph , twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame , Miss Ada said , `` By rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won't take my clotheshorse '' .
And it was his main present ! !
`` Really , Winston .
`` She's been talking about a picture '' , Winston had told him .
`` Picture ! !
Winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown .
`` Look , an old man .
I'm going to put it on my dresser '' .
`` I'll give you a medical certificate , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada had said .
Was it love ? ?
It was late , we were playing kissing games , and Jessica and I were called on to kiss in front of the others .
We blushed and were flustered , and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek .
It was at that party that , finally overcoming my timidity , inspired by tales only half-understood and overheard among older boys , I asked Jessie to spend New Year's Eve with me .
Among my school and neighborhood friends , during the next months , I bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date .
It was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the Astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking .
It seemed incredible , as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients , that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going to a hospital for the mentally ill .
I had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall Field & Co. .
I asked .
Don't tell me about drunks .
`` I wouldn't have gone into nursing if I didn't care about people .
When I think of people like you , well , I '' --
They all mean well , have great promises to make when they are about to go home , but drinking is their sickness .
There was no money for tuition , for clothes , for all the things you apparently take for granted .
What about your that girl you were going to kill '' ? ?
It was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there .
As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking over the events of the past two weeks , trying to put the pieces in order .
We opened on Friday and closed the following Monday .
I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up , then went to the bathroom for a drink of water .
`` All right '' , I said .
He had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me .
He asked .
Can you find it all right '' ? ?
One of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street , trying to make himself inconspicuous , keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting .
Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary .
He came out alone .
`` Oh , that's all right '' , he said .
You don't want to lease a place way out in the sticks .
I was held up a bit trying to make a left turn .
Traffic was pretty heavy .
I stayed half a block behind him , letting lots of cars keep in between us , listening to the steady beep beep beep .
I turned left too soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right .
I could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasn't traffic .
not like the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment .
I reached over and switched off the electronic bugging device .
Roberta glanced up at her husband .
Dave had the latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open .
It was getting light .
The fat man removed his apron , put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket , and zipped it over his paunch .
`` Howda I know '' ? ?
`` Remember how she looked when Barney held the door for her ? ?
`` -- had enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the parents -- I coulda let her go go '' -- His eyes were lowered , so he couldn't have seen the narrow , pointed face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury ; ;
but he was aware of it just the same .
Grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar .
And put Cate's gun back '' .
`` I know '' .
Grosse spread his hands .
`` Dammit all , Vince .
`` I got one question '' .
Barney was not really frightening .
So , he understood her panic .
She blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle .
Still no answer .
He seemed to be looking at a point above the little window .
Lauren said , `` Please '' ? ?
Her heart was thumping painfully ; ;
Her mother and father , for instance .
Her father's attention would be on the road ahead and it wouldn't deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the Falls and took the River Road to LaSalle and , finally , turned in at their own driveway at 387 Heather Heights .
`` Dave .
There was a wet spot -- she couldn't have been gone long '' .
He inserted the car key in the lock .
He asked , keeping his voice casual .
Perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town .
He remembered a story he had read as a youth .
Now Acey and his friends were returning to seek him out .
There was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch .
And then the station wagon and the Ford would seek him out again .
He lost all sense of dignity .
They would reach him at almost exactly the same instant .
In a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by on the other side .
It was the sound of a siren .
Why didn't you wait at the Burch house ? ?
Every man in every one of these houses is a Night Rider .
He listened a moment and then said , `` Hold it '' .
Rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up .
Shayne said briskly , `` Grab another drink if you want it .
`` It's out in the Northeast section .
Shayne asked , peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign .
Turn to the left , I think , for that number you gave me .
Shayne drove westward from the Boulevard slowly , letting Rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers .
`` The things you talk me into , Mike .
Shayne chuckled .
I made them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on Felice Perrin '' .
Be excited and don't identify yourself .
Then hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address .
Shayne strode out blithely , and Rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink , getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police .
He went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat .
Geely grunted and slid partly out , and Shayne's left arm snaked in around his neck to help him , while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big , gum-chewing jaw before Geely could straighten up .
He dropped him into the street a couple of feet away from Geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side .
`` They'll have fun explaining that to the Miami cops .
A row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them .
Mickey was on his knees when Roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand .
Mickey waited with slack arms .
Then Roberts was on him , gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade .
He got a knee up into Roberts' belly , used both hands and heaved him clear , then scrambled to his feet .
There's no way to take him in now and keep those other two -- Wister and the one who hired the two of them -- from finding out about Roberts and lamming out .
The local law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more than that .
Only me .
He climbed the stairs , went into Roberts' room , found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could .
He left a few things .
Roberts was a wastrel .
He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing .
It snowed softly , silently , an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky .
The body was heavier than he had anticipated .
The soft snow was deceitful underfoot .
It was too late to worry about that .
It was a relief to get rid of the weight .
He went back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel .
He judged her to be a woman of some pride , though not much sense .
That courtyard picture with the same initials '' .
He explained the background of the case , ending with the tenuous clue which had brought him to Gulf Springs .
But , of course , you couldn't see too well through the veil '' .
Do they still live here '' ? ?
Mr. Ferrell is a private detective , Hirey .
`` I'll just leave the door open .
`` They're all here , back to 1865 '' , Carruthers told him .
Near it was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf .
There was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom .
Now for their exodus from Gulf Springs .
The item said Mr. and Mrs. Black had moved to Jackson , his home town -- so the lovely Lisa had been with him a year ago .
In the middle of the stock market crash , he heard a slight noise in the outer office .
Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here , had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted .
To come back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left ? ?
Nobody could hear what was going on in this underground vault .
`` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure .
`` That's a long while '' , said Angie .
`` It's O.K. , Denny , everything's O.K. Ain't it , Mr. Skyros '' ? ?
I don't know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but I'll try my best , my friend .
You see , you got to remember , we all got schedules , like any business ! !
A couple decks for me , Mr. Skyros -- and ten-twelve to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash '' .
`` Sure , Mr. Skyros .
Sure .
`` Standard deal , Mr. Skyros .
He got out of there in a hurry , brushing past another man in the door , mopping his brow .
After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through .
She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks .
The kind who came into a cheap store like this ! !
To be Katharine Ross , and work in a nicer shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes , and learn ladies' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up to now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign-sounding names , the ones went to the same church and -- Different place , different job , different people , she'd be all different too .
He asked her severely .
Happened to hear you quarrel about her ! !
Sarah remembered it clearly .
She opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you .
`` I forgot .
She had swished away , she had been gone for a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , pour out the coffee , so no one would drink it .
She was deeply , horribly sure that Lucien had filled it with opium .
Sarah had begun to tell Lucien of Emile , she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door , open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall .
she wouldn't run like a scared cat .
Rev had stressed the need for money .
She come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you '' .
Glendora flapped away .
She ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway , with the rain dripping from the vines .
She stood for a moment , rain dripping from the trees over her head , thinking of Maude .
She couldn't see how her death could affect Maude .
George had a tack hammer .
Rev looked up and saw her .
And what news , Sarah thought as satirically as Maude might have said it .
Her words jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in Rev's face .
Now why did I do that ? ?
She thought as warm , drizzling rain touched her face .
But he still wanted to know why .
She was the sun , he the closest planet orbiting around her , the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed .
He looked at Gilborn with undisguised curiosity .
Except that Kitti wasn't there .
Who ? ?
Who ? ?
He would lie in it no more .
Gilborn put on his coat again .
The figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter .
He hadn't .
She thought she was going to die .
But Blanche had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother's continued carping , had been able to resist her urgings to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony .
And then , unexpectedly , Stanley made his announcement .
Kitti could have married a score of men .
Blanche knew all this because the door to Stanley's office was open and , without straining too hard , she could hear everything that was said .
Stanley had gone out , saying he would be back in an hour .
On the morning of Stanley's return , however , her strength left her .
Mostly , she stayed in bed .
In the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that , pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that .
Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered woman's apartment , we might have had less trouble convincing Felix of our seriousness .
You're a taxpayer , householder , landlord .
We were not , however , prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as Felix came up the stairs .
Felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house .
He had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short .
For a man of his mass he was curiously short .
We waited till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him .
`` Felix '' ? ?
`` You live in the present '' ? ?
Come right along .
We followed him up the stairs .
He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance .
And once Bake slipped in , pale and drawn , last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it .
He asked if there was anything he could do .
They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel , but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub .
It was signed by everyone in the troupe .
Andy couldn't help but be touched .
My men have been here all afternoon , setting up for this thing '' .
What do you expect to get tonight , anyway ? ?
But Bonner departed , still full of ill will .
`` What's he complaining about '' ? ?
They were right .
the evening was still not beyond salvaging , not as a show but for him as a person .
Vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held .
He drew a deep breath .
Ray , if you please -- the ' Cradle Song ' '' .
He wondered if the audience would let him finish .
But when he was finally through , their scorn was made apparent .
Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped .
The money's here , all of it '' .
All the king's horses and all the king's men
His son watched until he got as far as the hall , almost out of sight , then hurried after .
under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory .
`` They took it away , overalls or something '' .
His voice grew high and trembling .
`` Also , that Mr. Ferguson was here .
He rose from his chair .
For a moment he thought of going into Crosson's office to explain that he had to leave , but there was now such a pain in his chest , such a pounding in his head , that he decided to let it go .
It was just that little accidents played into her hands .
She wouldn't be wilfully planning his destruction .
He drove , and the road wobbled , familiar scenes crept past on either side .
There was really no place to go , finally , except home to Mae .
Cooper was beside his car , on the curb at the right , just standing there morosely ; ;
A new idea drifted in from nowhere .
Good-bye .
`` I've been looking for them , and they're gone .
Put down the cup of coffee .
She took another bite of toast .
`` I've never owned any painting overalls .
A man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long , dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said , `` Is this more like it , Mrs. MacReady ? ?
he had been at the Dumont for almost a week .
Failing to find what was wanted , as was most likely , check out other guests , with special -- but not exclusive -- attention to those with rooms on the street .

that she was active in the Woman's Club and he in Lions , Rotary , and Jaycee ; ;
She'd have consulted us , you see .
Very nice for him .
Brian Thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator .
He occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor , using the second bedroom as his office .
Airy and bright , the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture , rugs , and draperies .
It contained a desk , files , a typewriter on a stand , and two big leather armchairs .
Thayer folded it up and offered a drink .
`` It's all I think about , too .
`` I'll show you how wrong you are .
`` Facing us , two flights up .
Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders .
`` Listen to me , Leigh .
If you want to spend another day in the State Department -- another day -- you get in there and tell that captain what I told you '' .
`` Easy does it , Phil .
He turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back .
He took several large swallows , recollected that Docherty had gone up another flight , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him .
it was hideously embarrassing -- `` not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer '' .
`` Why not '' ? ?
Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared ? ?
`` Would you mind sending him up here ? ?
they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting .
Hoag turned .
Most of them could be eliminated ; ;
With a cop patrolling the road Muller would have to be inside a building -- if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La Guardia Airport .
the room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain .
He had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town house , and its owners were in residence ; ;
Now what ? ?
Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes .
He paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead .
Was there time ? ?
His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door .
a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him lurching heavily from the table .
The lieutenant eyed Gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then glanced back at his own face , moving the comb methodically around his head .
Roll was being called .
`` I called the station at three this morning '' , Killpath's nasal voice pronounced .
A car pulled into the driveway outside the window .
Gun held his breath a moment , pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat .
`` Sir .
Gun stiffened , his hands balling into fists at his sides .
Mr. Phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of Mission Street .
He was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set up , with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave .
An only child , he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke .
She had grown up with young Jenkins , and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice .
Casey watched them go , still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check .
Because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours , he did not think to look and see if Jerry Burton's car was still there .
The discarded papers inside were sodden , there was a glint of liquid at the bottom , and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct .
Even so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly .
`` Look '' , he said .
That's all I know about it and that's all I care '' .
`` But I meant what I said , Casey .
He , Casey , had been scared for a while , but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible .
If you want a picture get to the corner of Adams and Clark just as fast as you can .
He did not bother with his radio -- there would be time for that later -- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned .
Once , in New York , he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane with a single engine .
No one had prayed .
All had fallen into a complete silence , listening to the wind whistle over the wings .
There had been tension in the plane during the silent descent ; ;
a tension similar to the one now .
Elaine nodded .
Nick asked , apprehensively , staring at the weapon .
They remained close together , their air trail wiggling like serpents traveling side by side .
Off to the west a beautiful schooner slowly beat its way into the wind , headed on a tack toward San Clemente .
Strolling down to the galley , he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated , poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom .
`` Any luck '' ? ?
Poet shook his head , sliding his face mask up on his forehead .
Poet ! !
Her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin , her body absolutely motionless .
And then Nick knew that all of them knew Elaine , himself and Poet .
But her walk was too steady , too slow , telegraphing her fear .
Springing like a cat , he leaped back , swooped up the spring gun and , whirling , pointed it toward the cabin .
The rubber and glass face mask slipped from Poet's forehead , bounced painlessly off Nick's chin , then disappeared .
Poet twisted again and Nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank , ripping off the skin .
You sure climbed fast , Jed .

Nellie was in the kitchen , had just come to work , when she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room .
`` Yeah , it's a real load '' , I told him , looking up the street at my battered Ford .
Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house , and when the Jaguar stopped I managed to swallow .
Nellie Harris wasn't old , she was ancient -- a tiny shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune .

We did 80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks .

Interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk .
Diana Beauclerk was a second-rate actress living in New York .
Daniel Forbes , her divorced husband , lived there .
Opposite the number 1105 stood one word : Unoccupied .
The clerk's glance followed Alec's .
At the same rate '' .
`` Anybody with a contagious disease been in there '' ? ?
`` There is no story '' , he piped tremulously .
There was no hint of a violent struggle now .
Deal furniture with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store .

There were three -- one leading to a bathroom , one to the hall , and one to the room next door which was immovable -- locked or bolted on the other side .
Alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table .
He crawled into bed and switched off the light .
In less than five minutes Alec was asleep .
The bedsprings betrayed him with a creak .
He lashed out blindly with his right .
Alec waited a moment , on guard .
Nothing happened .
What has this to do with the present ? ?
They had learned , both of them , about Abraham Wharf .
Yes , gentlemen , I am getting to the point , to my point .
Just think of old Granther Stannard who pulled the teeth of Dark Younger ( her real name was Dorcas ) , and because he bungled the job and left two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs were made of glass .
After that he was never known to run or even walk fast .
Those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity took on some of the moraine's stony character .
) Even I can remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars , and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man .
Both Red McIver and Handley Walker lived nearby , almost as near as I do .
They are ? ?
) Well , anyhow , Dogtown Common is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only Sunday picnickers still stray up there , from time to time .
Sea-road , railroad , lack of water , killed Dogtown .
I knew Red and Handley well .
As I said , they were both painters .
What's that ? ?
One other cause of jealousy between them I must tell you .
Gloomy and unkempt as Red McIver was , he was much the better painter .
Eyes that were clear , but also bright with a strange intensity , a sort of cold fire burning behind them .
No , the man was not drunk
His shout had been involuntary , something anybody might have done without thinking , on the spur of the moment .
Phil usually went alone and kept to himself , sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges .
When he finally got the coughing under control , he realized that Pete ( all he gave was his first name ) was still waiting for an answer -- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to stare .
Thanks anyhow '' .
Why don't they tell me themselves if it bothers them '' ? ?
It will take a little time .
I want to study your landlord's habits and movements first .
Pete smiled modestly .
Of course On Thursday , Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife Lolly , and wished the stranger could do something about her
He had already quite forgotten about him .
He began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing .
`` But why pay her bills ? ?
If she runs around with other men , and if you hate her as you say , why not just divorce her '' ? ?
`` That bitch would love a divorce '' , he growled .
You should have told me about her before '' .
Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass .
He hesitated a second , looking at the bottle , before he said `` Sure-sure '' , and I reassured him .
`` Perfect set-up '' , I told him .
On the way I gave him the scoop .
I introduced my friend Larry to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable .
This was the same , except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves .
It was a lead pipe cinch .
There was a sound like the one you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger , only louder , and Pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise .
That way we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice .
Charlie said , `` Good boy .
The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out .
We decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow .
he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down .
He'd been there several times , back when , while he and Radic had been friends , or at least not enemies .
I took a deep breath , and the plunge .
And , in case , I brought the money with me '' .
there was much to grok , loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing -- all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel Foster Tabernacle ( not just cusp when he and Digby had come face to face alone ) why Bishop Senator Boone made him warily uneasy , how Miss Dawn Ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not , the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and wailing --
he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling , struggling to bridge between languages , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in .
The word `` church '' which turned up over and over again among Jubal's words gave him knotty difficulty ; ;
In his mind he spoke simultaneously the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer grokking .
Repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana .
`` A fine idea '' , Mike agreed .
`` Mike , there's Mars .
He hesitated ; ;
the question was too wide for the sparse English language .
`` Larry teaches plants to grow .
Mike had not heard it ; ;
`` You knew him '' ? ?
He rolled toward her and took her in his arms .
Part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of Mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations .
A funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting .
Digby calmed down , but made one request .
But , I'm telling you , it'll be turned down -- you don't understand the System yet .
`` You mean this punk can brush me aside and I've got to hold still for it '' ? ?
His household had gone through an upset .
Jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting -- ABC vs D , then BCD vs A or AB vs CD , or AD vs CB , through all ways that four women can gang up on each other .
Even rock-steady Anne -- Hell , Anne was the worst ! !
`` Forgive me , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .
Was ? ?
`` Please pardon me again , Sandalphon '' , said Hal .
Perhaps , the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hal's child would no longer be present .
Then , after slowing the vessel considerably , the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration .
And , from the first , he faced a difficult task .
the sounds made by these organs were , therefore , dissimilar .
( Or , perhaps , especially in an Angel , whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago .
There was nothing he could do but wait .
`` We misjudged you '' , he said slowly .
of curiosity ; ;
`` All the more reason , then '' , Jack said , `` why we must have a treaty .
Yet there was some precedent for it .
The history of disarmament agreements , for instance , had been unreassuringly dismal ; ;
suspicion between member states still existed , but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between Arizona and California over water supplies .
In fact , it had to be tried .
but there was no small way to handle this one .
For a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw .
Gradually , he realized that the pentagon of Angel elders had vanished , and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up .
`` Where ? ?
It seemed unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the Ariadne , for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a light-year .
The sail , ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars .
The curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't be argued with , however .
Without an instant's transition , the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board .
His small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face .
These planets were much bigger , nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere .
`` Animals .
Ringing the ship .
Think they're intelligent , maybe hostile '' ? ?
`` I think they're dead '' , Ekstrohm interjected quietly .
`` Easy '' , Nogol confirmed .
The strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects .
They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground .
Dissect it '' ? ?
`` I think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here .
`` But what about our landing was lethal to the creatures '' ? ?
Ekstrohm suggested .
`` Maybe '' , the captain admitted .
These critters went real sudden '' .
There was a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground .
Ekstrohm stood up .
But what was there to do ? ?
Ekstrohm never slept .
Others admitted he was absolutely correct -- he never slept .
Naturally , he couldn't let his shipmates know this .
Insomnia would ground him from the Exploration Service , on physiological if not psychological grounds .
In a camp , instead of shipboard , hiding the secret was easier .
On impulse , he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble .
It took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order , and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting , sleeplessly .
What did you do with them '' ? ?
What do you think I did with them '' ? ?
There was no ring of animal corpses .
Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this '' ? ?
You've been riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that '' .
Now comes this ! !
`` Ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies .
I give you my word I'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke , or to deliberately foul up the expedition .
Ryan shook his head .
Any other reaction would have been reported instantly .
`` You people don't have adjustable vision '' .
`` Here , this will help '' , suggested Helva , substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture .
She would work out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing .
After experimentation , Helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone .
She compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them , not at all unharmonious , merely unique .
Shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work .
Her first actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight , showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession .
`` No one has come .
He stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt .
We can die , too , we can die like real people .
Mercer smiled at her through his happiness .
The half-man laughed with something close to real humor .
Mercer got the blissful needle .
he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately .
Or was that after the torso and legs , waist to toe-tips , of the little girl which had grown from his side ? ?
but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope , `` People never live forever '' .
The bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them .
`` People never live forever '' .
They did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all .
Now I can only write , and that only when I get out of pain .
He cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his Winchester , and started downstream .
He asked , `` Could we have a drink '' ? ?
She had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked .
Her blond hair was frowzy , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection .
They looked a good deal alike , Morgan thought .
Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth .
`` We've been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down '' .
`` I'll see '' , Morgan said .
`` I'm a mess '' , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed .
`` Who are you ? ?
`` I don't have many strays coming to my front door '' , he said .
`` Start in .
It's not much of a meal , but it's what I eat '' .
When he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on .
You'll have to go to town to see the doc '' .
The girl asked .
The bed isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there '' .
He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' .
`` We got fired '' , Jones said .
`` He stuck with me all these years .
I treated them fair ''
Now there's nothin left of me .
Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .
There isn't much time .
`` She doesn't want you now .
I have to think about it .
A man could make a mark there .
`` Yes , like a father and son '' .
`` I loved this valley '' , he whispered huskily .
Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .
In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .
The silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search .
The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies .
He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .
That's what you wanted , isn't it ? ?
Joe Purvis was thinking back many years .
He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water .
Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night .
The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow .
The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion .
Julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him .
Mike silenced them .
But it at least offered him a chance for living .
No doubt there would be men guarding the horses .
`` The way you were careful '' ? ?
He snorted .
And using him , Mike McLish , as a sop to her pride .
`` Up you go '' ! !
`` Ride '' ! !
It's our only chance now .
He lifted a screeching war whoop .
They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar .
The orderly room seemed to be deserted .
A brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches .
Its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again .
Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down .
Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door .
The iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars .
Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house .
The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings .
The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem .
Hurry '' ! !
Lew Durkin yelled .
`` So it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village '' ! !
Hell , they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else .
I saw that letter .
The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on Montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day .
Oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; ;
`` Wait until my shot .
His mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams .
Montero's rifle cracked .
The feathered lance was still above his head .
He started to run but Oso's shot caught him on the wing .
In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger .
Montero's shot had caught him high in the chest ; ;
But a few reached our wall .
In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song .
He was losing patience again .
That fire's too big .
She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face .
She said , and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly .
I ought to .
Somebody might mistake you for a woman '' .
`` That quirt -- I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good .
If you've got any ideas '' .
`` He's a friend .
He had known women like that , one woman in particular .
He found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream .
If she did , he could stand it better in the light .
Well , the grass was there , though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it .
The place had been cheap -- just the little he had left after Amelia's burial -- and it would serve its purpose .
But there was water .
Sometimes I was aware of people moving about in the darkness .
I would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded .
I felt certain it was self-appointed .
Large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted .
The sounds issuing from beyond -- winches whirring , men shouting -- indicated great activity and excited me .
But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it .
For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there .
I stopped by the counter .
Let's move '' .
Two men were on duty inside , playing pinochle , relaxed .
The sergeant froze .
It had gone without a hitch .
He had been one of the original Night Riders , one who had escaped the trial .
Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers .
The murderer lifted his head .
`` You aren't one of us .
He had done time for the theft .
A company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail '' .
Again Dill hesitated .
After another long pause he asked , `` How many people know who they are '' ? ?
`` The hell you do '' .
Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage , and I wouldn't entrust a snake to his tender care .
Chapter two
Barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places , carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult .
It was over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state .
Ten years older than Mitch Barton , he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation .
Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke .
The man was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a too-large nose .
So simple , in fact , that it might even work -- although Pamela , now , in her new frame of mind , was careful not to pretend too much assurance .
She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest .
There was only one place where the mountain might receive her -- that unnamed , unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom .
Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream .
The forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand .
Birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun , all dewy-eyed and soft , caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time .
She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants .
In her grim pursuit of tranquillity , Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband .
If , when this was all over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand .
Indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined , ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor .
Her arm bled slightly , and the offended skin cried out in pain .
She had the feeling that , under the mouldering leaves , there would be the bodies of dead animals , quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain .
clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws .
She began it deliberately , so that none of her words would be lost on him .
Do you hear me ? ?
He opened the door and got out .
Lips pursed mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side .
But she'd known plenty of handsomer guys , and , conceding his good looks , what was there left ? ?
He could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong .
Now , are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk '' ? ?
On the other hand , howsomever , maybe you wouldn't either .
`` Well , let's get going '' , she said impatiently .
`` I '' -- She broke off , frowning .
She looked at him , lips compressed .
He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned .
It poured out of him like an electric current , a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action , and that that action would be all that he anticipated .
That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride , field boss for the Highlands Oil & Gas Company .
So , `` How about it '' ? ?
`` We aim t' be see-lective , y'know ? ?
An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks .
Not immediately , as the deputy demanded .
He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air .
Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it .
He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero , Luis Hernandez .
They were considering it gravely , neither seeming to like what he planned .
Finally Hernandez said , `` I could offer you advice , Tomas , but you wouldn't heed it '' .
`` She won't change her mind '' , Brannon said .
How long should I wait '' ? ?
`` Maybe in a year , Tomas .
`` In my place , you'd follow such advice as you give me '' ? ?
Like Luis , I can't see something like this happening to me .
And the boy will need his mother .
Brannon shook his head .
I am with you , of course , Tomas '' .
He didn't want to put himself outside the law .
He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there .
`` Maybe to have supper .
He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain .
`` He's finished eating '' , Hogan said .
It shouldn't be long '' .
It seemed long , at least to Tom Brannon .
`` Just come along '' , Brannon told him .
`` Let's go , Marshal '' , Brannon said , and took him by the arm .
Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm .
He lifted the skirt of Macklin's coat , took his gun from its holster , tossed it onto the desk .
Brannon said , `` Now the key to the lockup , Marshal '' .
Come on -- the key .
Brannon , you've assaulted a law officer and '' --
They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear .
The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron .
And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard .
But the day of the deadline came and passed , and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction .
After walking out to his corral that morning , he'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet .
He hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread .
`` I'll be shootin' right back '' .
This time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands , and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot , then spent most of the day searching out the area .
It took some time to locate Horn .
For a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do .
Tom Horn was soon back at work , giving his secret employers their money's worth .
Harnessing a team to a buckboard , they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off , then climbed down and began chopping .
He looked around in surprise , then noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest .
Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin .
But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies , and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing .
There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots .
Once again , he shook his head , kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi ready .
They wouldn't o' stood no chance with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down '' .
The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement .
But there's one thing I never seen or heard of , one thing I just don't think there is , and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man '' ! !
The small half-heartedly tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow .
`` My reputation's my stock in trade '' , Tom mentioned more than once .
`` I have a little job for you , Charlie .
`` What is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner '' ? ?
`` It doesn't seem quite right , telling her a thing like that .
As Curt had hoped , the house door banged open .
`` Just hold it that way '' .
There was raw fury in his eyes , and the veins of his neck were swollen .
Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster .
Now draw '' ! !
Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist .
Pain shot up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder , but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit .
His aim was hurried ; ;
When his head came down , Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall .
This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle .
`` Sally '' , admonished her mother , `` you've got all evening to visit with Dan .
Damn it , he thought bitterly , picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve .
Pa ! !
`` What about Burnsides '' ? ?
By then Hez could see for himself , and so could the others .
But even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day .
Then , and only then , with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor , did the Harrows take time to catch up on the news .
`` Nor Methodists , neither '' , she replied .
Rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied .
He looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers .
By now Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting , or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them .
`` How's Sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising '' ? ?
Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock , official signboard for the Raft River turnoff , and gloated , `` Seems funny that them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar '' .
Before Harmony had a chance to reply , Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs .
Stevens was nowhere in sight .
Muffling an exclamation , Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down .
His eyes widened .
The door was locked .
Cobb watched this with hunted eyes , his desperate hope waning by the moment .
Count what you've got there , Cobb .
Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him , Pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out .
To his faint surprise Russ held up his hand .
Then maybe next time he won't be so quick on the trigger '' .
Nearing home , he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun .
In town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot ; ;
He tightened up in a twinkling .
He ain't gone far '' ! !
Leading his pony , he hurried that way , not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range .
Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target .
The sky glowered down at them .
Donovan snatched Greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it .
Yet long before the scheduled time for return , Donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky .
`` Todman , let's try to go under this stuff .
The valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn .
The ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet , and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in .
If the other pilots were worried , they did not show it .
Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle .
Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability , American on speed and firepower .
But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy , if it was the enemy , and he hadn't been spotted already .
In seconds , Greg made his decision .
`` Sweeney Blue , hit the deck .
`` They haven't seen us '' , Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise .
`` Now , Sweeneys , now .
He took a lead on the enemy , using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another .
The Jap's propeller flew off in pieces .
Wingman , stay clear , he prayed .
Over the rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage Herry's black brushcut was just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot where -- hidden -- more delicately-textured , most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes .
Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me .
Squeezing a look between Johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired `` Y'all drahve '' ? ?
I said that it didn't make any difference to me either , as far as I knew .
Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all .
White teeth suddenly vanishing , the driver slammed the side of his bottle against Johnson's ear .
Prairie dogs were popping up and popping down .
Johnson's left hand was pressed against the side of his head , red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers .
`` That was Tee-wah I was talking .
`` Hell , that's all right , buddy '' , the Indian ( I now guessed ) said .
the car's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center .
Brakes shrieked behind us .
I looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car's rear window .
I quickly turned around and began to drink .
I guided her to the divan , turned off the TV , faced her .
Haven't we haven't I seen you .
I mean , surely we've '' --
And you recognized me '' ? ?
Man , you rang -- it was in color , too , Miss , and Miss ? ?
, Inc. .
`` Did leap into the pool , and didn't have anything on .
`` I didn't know .
The man shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana .
`` No , I never did see his face .
I didn't get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and I was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit .
Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater Western Eye , a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits .
As far as I was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do .
Seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles , and I smiled all the way into the bedroom .
There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room .
`` Itch '' ? ?
It'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you .
`` Well , goodbye '' , I said .
She wouldn't be taking a cold shower .
`` What were they doing here '' ? ?
I asked Rawlins .
The rest of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting .
I dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship .
Why she married him I do not know .
He already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly , while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living .
his bride opened the store .
Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks , and subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights .
She placed her palms , fingers outspread , on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say , `` Now , what next '' ? ?
There was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour .
It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch .
`` I guess we both felt it '' .
`` I guess so '' , she said .
Even as I said it I realized that an education can be invaluable .
Get thrown out ? ?
If I even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew -- and not even a blood nephew '' ? ?
`` But you '' -- she began .
Shortly before nine I drove my jalopy to the street facing the Lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view .
In one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain .
She didn't have the heart .
Nicolas : `` Look , Nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys -- no sex , see ? ?
So if all these beers was to get me in bed , man , you just spent a lot of money '' .
She was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth .
Her eyes had opened , she had caught a glimpse of a new faith .
He blew his nose expertly between his fingers .
A thing he did not like doing , generally .
He flexed his muscles for several minutes , got into the tub , and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed .
The result was grace and modesty .
Having opened the windows onto the terrace , lit the fire , translated the motto , Meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin .
`` I think the maids tipple in the afternoon '' .
Steinhager '' She whispered Steinhager to herself , several times , memorizing it .
Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen .
`` Hoa-whup '' ! !
He commanded from his raw throat , and felt the pain of movement in his cracked , black burned lips .
He spat .
He cleared his throat and wet his lips .
She had hated the whole idea before they started .
`` Don't try to be noble '' ! !
He darkened under his heavy burn .
He swung up over the wheel .
His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard .
She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current .
He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins , leaving the ribs and wagon open .
He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters .
The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare .
Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water .
Now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the Pacific , for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon .
He had been speaking of this archipelago :
In fact , one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men '' .
It is Eromonga -- look hard , you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff '' .
A fine example of engineering in a primitive society .
`` What is the scaffolding for , Brassnose '' ? ?
Our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what I had heard of the inhabitants of Eromonga , I was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft .
You shall have food , water and rest '' .
Some had been there for years ; ;
They were shattered .
It took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one , which is higher and stronger than the old one .
Brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly , `` Sommers , you meddling Yank , you're a fool ! !
they destroy such men with their damned tests .
For an anthropologist , loquacious old L'Turu was a mine of information .
Within a decade or less , few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up .
`` Karipo's women then named this place ' Eromonga ' -- manhood -- for just the strongest men could stay here .
`` I'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand , the liquor or automobiles '' .
Somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver .
Benson said , referring to the Indian .
It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist , an ex-truck driver like Horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head .
Every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear .
`` What outfit does she drive for '' ? ?
The truck routes , the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind -- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay .
Her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing .
`` What does he want , a spoon '' ? ?
The slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot , yet the toes were still inside .
The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man .
He turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes , immaculate eyes .
The man said .
`` But what is it '' ? ?
The man said with a tone of impatience .
The man had spoken only once .
Ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth .
The man on the ground began to move ; ;
None of the crowd had stepped forward to help .
Ramey said nothing .
The body continued to lash , but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome , bloody mass out of the bungalow .
I don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life , but I am .
`` The snake was beautiful , wasn't it '' ? ?
Now , she just sat there looking at him , without an expression except concern for him .
Wing Commanders in the RAF do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes , to their men or to themselves .
He knew how to shoot down Nazis .
Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity .
Penny knew him better , on her part .
He was on the thin side , with big hands , and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep .
He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself .
That was his true love , not Penny .
He stared stonily at the floor .
I've been that far half a dozen times .
And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself .
Not right away '' .
Waddell , the newspaperman , was a fellow in his middle forties , with a graying crewcut , heavy-framed glasses , and a large jaw padded with fat .
`` I do not drink so much , thank you '' .
`` I agree , yes '' .
`` And if the dive goes OK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country , is that right '' ? ?
`` Well , damn '' , Waddell said .
There was the end of his front-page feature story , with byline .
Waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk .
I will make him distributor for all of Florida -- a big market .
Yes ! !
He sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps .
Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions .
`` Blessed Saint Nicholas , I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when I was bewildered .
Whichever the way , he would rot in this vast choking green , his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes .
The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face .
The marines let him advance .
The pockets of his jacket bulged .
Hand grenades .
One by one he tossed the objects aside .
The marine blinked , soon dropping his hand .
Sake .
`` Be a good turtle '' .
`` Are you a thrower of flame , marine '' ? ?
Matsuo walked toward his tree , once glancing back .
`` Sake '' ? ?
The marine was a winehead .
he was very thirsty , but he must observe water discipline .
Popping upright , the marine waved both hands and shouted .
`` Marine .
In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform , smudged , blood-specked , with the village burning about him and shells exploding .
He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver .
Most of the time I get what I ask for '' .
A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting .
`` OK , Tilghman , I'm quitting '' .
`` And me '' , said another Blue Throat henchman .
He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to Main Street .
`` If Blue Throat has his way he'll keep us all cooped up in here for days '' , he said .
He slipped outside , hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways .
Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the Old West , `` Uncle Billy Tilghman '' stands out head and shoulders .
Resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap , Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes .
But he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon .
`` Billy Tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back .
When she would do these things , he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach .
And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room Chestnut school , where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade , the Woman of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure .
The first two or three days they went home early .
All , that is , except Jack .
I guess it's this hot weather '' .
Miss Langford , in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals , without socks , was out there with them , trying to get them inside .
Presently she came out of the schoolhouse .
`` Let's play with 'em '' , Jack said , rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants .
He thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go .
`` I don't believe I'll play any more neither '' .
`` Me neither '' , others said , and soon the game broke up , the children going off in pairs , in larger groups and alone .
He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him , but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities : the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school .
`` You will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems '' .
Col. Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners .
I won't bite , you know '' .
One less shouldn't matter to him '' .
Such delicate beauty , such fine flesh .
It will rip and shred easily for Madame '' .
`` Be quiet , Devol ! !
Also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony .
Such a pitiful end '' ! !
Mrs. Victor Dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight .
The manservant Devol and his mistress , Delphine Lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion .
They have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !
There ain't nobody askin' for your ticket stub , neither '' .
The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .
Hot , that was the word , hot ! !
`` He's okay .
it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance .
Certainly not , I mean , no that isn't what I said '' ! !
`` I only said I was hungry .
Why , we got dinner right here .
Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .
He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .
`` A Kroger's self-serve '' , he explained .
So we ran away '' .
`` Why didn't he want you to get hitched '' ? ?
She looked down at her hands , too .
It was my fault '' .
It was all my fault .
Ernie's eyebrows went up .
`` What's the matter '' ? ?
But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about .
But these kids weren't like him .
The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .
He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .
`` No , I don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie .
The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .
He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat .
or the smell of thick tomato paste -- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour -- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth .
Not that one .
The Old Man's very soul could have left him and flown down that street , but he wouldn't have had anyone know it .
Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife .
Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city .
Only one house on the street had no lawn before it .
Even though the boy could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance .
And as for his pipe , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .
Pompeii rolled over .
Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud .
But the boy could see only the goat's belly .
He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta's idiot brother .
In desperation Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon : `` Do you think you could find me something I could do here at home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things '' ? ?
That kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight rates .
Shivering , people talked and argued ; ;
`` We will both go back , Laban '' ! !
Kizzie turned to go inside .
She swung around .
You told me to bring my camera .
Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny ! !
`` I'll decide that when I get there .
Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips :
`` Under the window in stormy weather
He questioned God's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it .
If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it .
There lay Grand Fair's Quinzaine , his own young parents' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons .
And don't tell me you didn't at church Sunday .
How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in -- spiritual ways .
He called her `` the Mare '' much as Mrs. Whipsnade spoke of `` the Queen , God bless her '' .
He didn't tell Miss Jen , but she must have got word from the cook or nurse , who of course knew those Quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit .
Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were getting on .
Miss Kiz won't care your comin' , will she '' ? ?
Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .
She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin .
There had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved .
She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .
Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .
A curious thought to end a curious night .
She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .
On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .
Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .
The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .
On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .
`` I'm taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .
See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin .
He regarded her with rising hope .
She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away .
I know all about you '' .
The day's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty's flowers .
She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .
Apparently they were of Caucasian blood .
all their men were bearded , and many of their women were beautiful .
A pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American Indians .
she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not granted .
Tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward .
There was a fifty-fifty chance , perhaps , that he would be unmarried , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different .
Then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke , and it was no different .
At least , he had the decency to blush , she thought .
She told herself rebelliously , and with pride , I am an American ! !
But she was learning that so long as she was in this country , and wore civilian dress in the Club , there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken English .
One had to have friends , and a congenial life in after-duty hours .
It was terribly off key , and poorly done , and Tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing , but all at once she felt lonesome and put-upon .
There was a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful .
Actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water .
At Yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the Base because Walt Perry , being thoughtful , knew that Doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the Supply Base .
There were two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the Naval Base , and visit an old shipmate .
`` Come over and have a drink .
We live down by the Base commissary .
He threw a smart salute at the gangway , went up the dock , and turned down the wide street in front of the Petty Officers' Club .
`` Hi , Buzz '' , Owen said .
Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to Reno for stag dinners .
When Owen was finally rid of him , there was a timid rap at the door .
`` Yes '' , Owen called out .
We call them lay-sisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the light .
`` You see '' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light , `` you and I can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo '' .
`` Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo '' ? ?
`` I don't know much about them '' , Owen admitted , `` but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do '' .
Forebearing , Owen kept his peace .
Do you know these women go all through Alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities ? ?
They travel in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day '' .
`` You're in the secular world '' .
`` I can imagine '' , she said .
He looked off to the crest of the Sierras , still white-topped ; ;
A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place .
But roulette's not my game .
Incidentally , I'm pretty famous in these parts : I'm called The Wrangler '' .
He was shorter and fatter than Owen , who felt good standing next to him .
`` We're all going over to Lake Tahoe and try our luck at Cal-Neva '' , Buzz explained , still instigating .
We'll get it in a hurry and get it out '' .
Hostile glances were flashed at both Alexander and Gansevoort .
An African knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by McKinley and Green .
`` Where did you gather all this information , Heiser ? ?
A glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away .
`` Small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast .
Then , with disappointment evident upon their faces , they moved to the work .
Wilson , shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by Green , McKee and McKinley .
Three days had passed since Spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers , new fears .
We are going to be rushed and murdered '' .
`` That is extravagant language , Mr. Wales .
God knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an egotist's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career .
To have someday that love returned was what he had lived for .
He is innocent '' .
There was good fortune and there was bad and Philip Spencer , in handcuffs and ankle irons , knew it to be a truth .
He expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune .
The hazel eyes met Alexander's .
His black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high .
She smiled .
He turned his surly , half-closed eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in Yiddish , `` One , two , three '' ! !
The little boys shrilled out a Yiddish translation or interpretation of the Five Books of Moses , which they had previously chanted in Hebrew .
They had large bright eyes , the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces .
The guttural language from the ghetto stopped .
Rachel said , `` He asks for money '' .
I resented them .
She loved the children .
Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos .
If she could not take the children out of this section , at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms .
I said quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at all , no matter how intimate , ready to be rebuffed , `` Then why did she leave Israel ? ?
But she sighed and her face relaxed .
This refugee was a middle-aged man , a big , handsome man with a strut to his walk as I have never before seen .
He loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him .
Then his son did something '' -- Rachel threw up her hands -- `` I don't know what , but something , to an official here -- it was during the Mandate -- and the son was imprisoned .
He took her to a doctor , for she was run down , nervous , did not care where she was .
`` And I'll take you with me '' .
But now the dream was over .
Out of the church and into his big car , it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college , his expansiveness , the quaint little pine board tourist courts , cabins really , with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight , like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid , where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs , watching in between your bouts at hopscotch ) , a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls , an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving .
You could wish that .
Or you could wish your daddy would really do it -- kill Gratt Shafer like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctured tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night .
He can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even Houdini couldn't figure out , how it is unlocked .
You feel where he is and what he sees , and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman , the one that never could love him the way you do , the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't .
You wonder about the Christmas card with no name on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted -- to give them you .
`` Damn the world '' , she thought .
He hit the theme about dying to defend your country , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought .
It was strange stuff -- it reminded me of the pictures of a child , but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults .
Mrs. Monmouth thought of him as her discovery , and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting .
I hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year .
I had admired him long before I talked to him .
It is as large as all of art , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' .
`` I'm studying anatomy with Burns '' , he replied .
I said .
Askington laughed .
`` You're missing the point '' , he said .
Contact with him is stimulating .
And that's the trouble with so many artists today .
That's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation .
After a short time , both George and Donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign on the door of the Brush-off reading out to work .
She asked .
`` Via must have it '' , I answered readily enough , recalling her last visit .
You know that '' .
`` I knew all this , but I paid no attention .
`` She's nowhere , nowhere '' ! !
Then the telephoning began .
I , who until that day before had been Mrs. Salter's friend , her equal , was the servant now .
`` If I am not to be Mrs. Salter then I am nothing '' .
And they have never changed .
she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised Mrs. Salter to return to the country .
Via was in the parking lot when I went outside .
Something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of Bach would give her some healing .
I think I was what you might call a convivial man , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio , doing my work , that I really felt alive .
But I think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with '' .
`` Don't you know all about me by this time ? ?
My name's Carla Caneli .
`` Well , all right then '' .
`` Let's go out '' .
I like them '' .
`` I don't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention .
They looked at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower Via Veneto , then they went to the Farnese Gardens .
Then they had dinner .
Aren't you going out to mass ? ?
Not his poor mother's fault .
`` If you find it necessary , Sam , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the stair .
When they walked into the Ferraro apartment , the old lady , bowing and smiling , said softly .
For a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar .
Did many of Sam's countrymen live in boxcars in the bush ? ?
It was said that he had had a vision .
Yes , the Pope could die and quickly be made a saint .
Elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small , curious clusters .
`` They do not have to face battle .
I will simply kill you first .
He shouted .
She said to him , her father , `` How was I begotten , in pain or joy ? ?
Suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard Pile of Clouds say in his high , quavering voice :
Walitzee was among them , and Sarpsis , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing .
They mounted their horses and rode off into the hills .
The sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears .
She stood , once more listening .
Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees .
It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ;
A quarter to seven .
He was supposed to be in court this afternoon , at City Hall .
For a moment he felt like a thief discovered .
`` No .
It's quite a big one '' , he added .
He imagined Sam's voice : `` George , what the hell goes on '' ? ?
I wouldn't have the strength to answer , he thought .
but that didn't matter .
He took her hand .
Someone laughed .
I'll get it hauled away .
For God's sake , don't worry .
I might struggle in for a jury .
A strange relationship between Joan Fulbright and himself .
She let him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her .
It was Jim's `` little '' sister Myra , the unreliable , irresponsible , forever flyaway , Myra .
Lucy listened .
Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible .
Then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had rung ; ;
Lucy was sick of it .
`` Well , at last '' , she said , because Susan was clattering down the stairs .
`` Do you need that big bundle '' ? ?
Jim groaned , but he lifted Susan's suitcase and said , in a gentler tone , `` Sure -- the entire thousand .
She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had .
Well , Lucy ? ?
Again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do .
Shocked speechless , Lucy sat there .
`` Christmastime ! !
'' Then it was no bogey she had dreamed up ; ;
Unlike Susan , she was traveling light ; ;
the worn teddy bear , a tiny suitcase that Jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had .
Lucy glancing at the miniature case , knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays ; ;
She opened the door .
The swirling sand made Quint's limp more pronounced .
Nobody around .
He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to .
Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ;
It's all right .
Stop shaking '' .
Strength began to zip up and down his chest .
He unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg .
He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks .
`` I said Quint .
`` I gotta go .
See you around , Mister Squint '' .
`` Which continent '' ? ?
Japan , she said , smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks ; ;
then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup .
Pugh .
Near Galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night .
Quint smothered a yawn .
( `` What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil ? ?
Let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' .
He hadn't .
Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough .
As for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time .
Same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement .
First , it came out after Mr. Cooper's will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that John and his mother weren't rich any more .
He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did .
She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at Longue Vue , but her bathing suits were far from smart .
John sold the big old place in Sewickley and bought a smaller house in Fox Chapel .
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company .
Everyone held his or her breath .
Bobbie said something about damned Pittsburghers sticking together , and Linda got angry at him .
So sure that money could do anything ! !
`` All right '' , I said .
`` I'll answer it '' .
`` Now you just take it easy , and I'll make you some tea '' --
And we don't have any money -- we don't have a dime ! !
`` Stop that ! !
Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him .
We can let them move in with us '' --
But , in the end , we did .
Chris made trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries Nadine had bought on special .
While I worked , Nadine sat and cried .
When she wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally .
Wendell Thom had black-balled him .
I mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air .
A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at .
Maybe I didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like , but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home .
I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it .
If she'd kept on as she'd been going , the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow
When we'd finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor .
We didn't get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights .
It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward .
Yes , Rose Bancroft , diagnosis : acute alcoholism .
An ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face , already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry .
But if she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left .
But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away .
`` What's this '' ? ?
`` Better do a Papanicolaou '' , I told Pete .
Pete stood by with a slide and took the smear , sent it down to the lab with a request for the test .
`` I sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said .
I was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor .
I looked at her in amazement .
Let your pupils learn on someone else , Doctor .
Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was .
`` You haven't got cancer '' , I said as strongly as I could .
But there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke .
`` Alice , for goodness sake '' --
Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it ? ?
I was twenty-one back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at Orly instead of Rhine-Main .
I never got there .
Toward the break of day I waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese .
I went to my hotel and slept .
)
She must have seen the ring on my left hand .
She smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile .
Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them .
We finished the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober .
I think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the rime had melted .
`` Bon jour '' ! !
`` Oh '' ? ?
As we ate , we talked .
This letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it .
Poor George ! !
Together with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong .
There they all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot .
`` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to ! !
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said .
) `` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them .
The man did not wish to leave .
Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two .
The lady with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ;
She arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other .
`` Signora '' ? ?
`` Mi diapiace , Signora , ma insomma .
She indicated a spot a little distance away .
And I've been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren .
I never heard my folks talk about her , though .
My love for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't hesitate to use her sex .
It was a vivid , sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff Dad had ordered .
But he wouldn't ask her -- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will .
Johnnie loved me and wanted me .
But the only love I was giving him was the pure kind .
`` I always imagined I would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that .
`` And you fall for a lumber jockey '' .
`` And '' , I was ticking off the items on my fingers , `` swears too much and goes out with the boys , whoever they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the fold '' .
`` And never show my face or my truck around here again '' .
`` You wouldn't '' .
`` Or I could visit Lucille Warren '' .
I was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the clutches of Lucille Warren .
Not really '' .
Of course he would .
No price is too high when true love is at stake .
But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group .
I hadn't been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever .
surely he was still resting snugly in my heart .
He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind .
Not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol .
`` Ugh '' .
Pink , Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy .
Just glad the rain's stopped '' .
I've got this cold '' .
`` So you said '' .
`` I've got this cold '' , he wrote .
He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper .
Charlie grinned .
`` You won't , if you're looking for a redhead .
There were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits .
Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn ? ?
Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion .
`` I'm not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair '' .
Then , in the fifth , Anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field .
But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now .
So help me God , I'll get him '' .
When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips .
He went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back .
Phil Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench .
Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side .
He arose slowly and brushed himself off .
`` Look at those bastards '' ! !
`` I'll be waiting '' ! !
The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head .
They were both walking towards each other , unhurried .
After the game , Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in .
Now that's just fine ! !
He pushed his jaw forward .
Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face .
`` I'm not trying to say anything '' .
But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room .
`` What difference does your batting average make ? ?
A sport ? ?
Phil thought .
His lips felt glued together .
Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` Someday you'll see I was right '' .
Phil shut the door behind him .
Phil shrugged .
`` Talk to Whitey Jackson '' .
`` Will you do it , Phil '' ? ?
`` I'm not worried about it '' , Phil said .
`` Nothing '' , Phil said .
Through quiet laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard '' .
Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again .
His interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian affairs .
He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject .
It was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it .
He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo .
Richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but Charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it .
Soba , udon and tea were In because they could be taken noisily .
`` Yes , a little parkish place '' , Charlotte said , and concluded , `` Anyhow , it's all very nice .
On the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of Fudo , or perhaps a demon .
He walked all the miles back to his room .
I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings .
It had grown hot early that day , and I hoped that the boy , my brother's son , would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground , carrying the jar of cool water .
The snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the furrow and did not go any further .
The colors were astonishing , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm .
I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance .
I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on .
He asked , as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me .
the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his .
`` They're ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted .
`` It was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself .
I said .
He looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side .
Yes , the boy's credentials were in order -- scholastic transcript , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards .
But due to the many applicants on file , would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? ?
His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief .
It wouldn't help anyway .
David had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness .
Health , excellent .
Just give him time , give him a chance .
After all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products .
Anne had a way with words .
Real bright along those lines , you might say .
`` Oh '' , said Mr. Partlow , `` that's fine , Tom .
But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket .
`` Can I have the car , Dad '' ? ?
Cady Partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse .
Cady begged the question .
`` Let's go into the library .
`` I didn't know I looked so dilapidated '' ! !
Astronomy .
Those aren't his interests now '' .
`` What do you suggest '' ? ?
Even in that he never solos like Jack on guitar or Rich on sax .
`` Yes , he's just there .
Just what '' ? ?
I won't be guilty of trying to run his life '' .
No doubt Dolores resented following in their footsteps .
He remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party .
Yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then .
`` Now , I'm not going to pick up those shorts '' ! !
He was wrong .
Clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' .
Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night .
He remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends , lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening .
She was talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` Afterwards Martin said he was sorry .
Some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's countenance .
Quite a few laughed .
Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment .
But Martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything .
He fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets , so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers .
Bizarre : He could hear the word .
The most bizarre situation .
He had thought her exactly what he wanted .
Pursuing his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now .
Everyone would know why ; ;
He was trapped .
Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same .
Furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts .
On the other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment .
The knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism .
To his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two garments .
`` You know , I've got one of your cars at home .
she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death .
Whatever the reasons , Willis and Bryan started expanding Zenith .
Since they were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam Herberet , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections .
With Herberet's blessing , he was convinced that Allstates' Wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind .
And Gerry .
Confronted by a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation .

Their cars weren't small enough , they didn't have the power , they were old-fashioned .
Welch wanted to know why .

In fact , it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi .
I sat and watched proceedings .
No .
They had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; ;
No , not Bermuda .
they had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names .
`` You are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , Fran had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but People Who Do Things '' .
Their house was a centuries-old Colonial which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and updated , and added on to .
Practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ;
She always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy , and that Koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs .
not Blanche .
I wouldn't have missed it for anything .
These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gazed , misty-eyed with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting .
They were always leaping to light cigarettes , open car doors , fill plates or glasses , and I mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that I mistrusted bake shops that called themselves `` Sanitary Bake Shops '' .
I'm a stranger in paradise '' .
The litigation was costly and seemingly endless .
My plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out '' .
Again , my name was on all the front pages .
He made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general .
Thanks to Letch Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable .
Only George Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss Poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood '' .
In a rare fit of anger and spite , I `` farmed out '' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment .
At the same time , however , I availed myself of the services of that great English actor and master of make-up , Sir Gauntley Pratt , to do a `` quickie '' called The Mystery of the Mad Marquess , in which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac .
Then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs .
Then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws .
How in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case ? ?
Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it .
On some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered .
Best not to get everything at once .
It gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments .
He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs .
`` We won't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- there'll be plenty more '' .
Ambiguity
In common parlance they would be described as misses -- misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds .
Another woman , addressing Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we '' ? ?
The misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach .
This creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word .
A verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain : `` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a drunken spree .

`` She really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed .
Actually , it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it .
