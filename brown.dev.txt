The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs .

The company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products .
Louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale .
It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations .
The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting : `` It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' .
In that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law .

Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the U-2 incident .
It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views .
The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 .
In Laos , the picture was almost equally bad .
But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary .

There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities .
Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university .
Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds .
Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility .
Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees .
But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' becomes more pressing .
This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated .
Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions .

The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 .
( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' .
The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition .
Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' .
Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ;

When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won .
Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast .
His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long .
Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player .
On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it .
Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer .
But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 .
The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions .
The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green .
( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ;
and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter .
To better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish .
All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new record .
Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games .
`` Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation '' , insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox .
Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` The important thing is to win the pennant '' .
Light reading :
Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips .
Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking .
But last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote .
I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk ' '' .
Maris's was Ted Williams .
Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio .
`` When Mickey went to the Yankees '' , says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver , `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his .
Mantle has kept the vow .

Both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state .

Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject to retraction .

But competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what Sen. Jackson lists as the primary need -- `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them '' .

The winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood .
Then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it .
Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , Mr. Podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness .
The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon .
But Mr. Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other .
Mr. Podger heard again ; ;

The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary General -- at this writing , the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .
Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites in the running , but France didn't like the former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter .
With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold , U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto .

Moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at least partially , and perhaps primarily social .
Somehow our contemporary Moloch must be induced to see reason .
As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race .
More recently , the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg , `` admitted '' to a news conference in Las Vegas , Nevada , that the US might fall behind Russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain .
Having hedged its bets in this way , PHS apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all : `` At present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected '' .
Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing .
The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if not exactly good for you , might not be much worse than a bad cold .
And once again , the choices are much the same .
In particular , Governor Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests .
Speaking recently in Miami , Governor Rockefeller said that `` to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests '' .
The possibility , as he asserted , that the Russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless , of course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand .
It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in the future , be necessary and even justifiable .
The refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start .
when his Holiness Pope John 23 , first called for an Ecumenical Council , and at the same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity , the enthusiasm among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate .
The establishment , by the Holy Father , of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern .

Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy programs are not too large but too small , most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures .

Key to the puzzles
Most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa , Katanga and Ghana , as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia , Africa and Latin America .
From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the `` uncommitted '' ( `` neutralist '' , `` contested '' ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- Nehru , Tito , Nkrumah , Sukarno , Betancourt , etc. .

The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story : what , in the secret councils of the Kremlin , Molotov had really proposed , we just don't know , and he has had no chance to reply .
But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated `` anti-party '' group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the `` transition to communism '' and , last but not least , on foreign policy .

As she gained composure during the second act , her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of `` Lucia '' .
Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the `` Mad Scene '' , but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment .
What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today .
In the fullness of her vocal splendor , however , she could sing the famous scene magnificently .

the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time .
But he rejects , perhaps a little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February , 1945 .
After all , Alger Hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents , was at Yalta .
It is quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like `` unconditional surrender '' had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism .

What was lacking was a real sense of phrase , the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is , after all , a very oily character .
Part of this characterization was , of course , accomplished with the vocal chords .
The English never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian madrigal .
Claude Jannequin's vocal description of a battle ( the French equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus .
Nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduced , make it an attractive look-see at the period .
Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote , not in the later sense of `` program music '' but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance .
All these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic .
Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez .

He prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like .
He met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo .
Tracing the blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West Indies , he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches .
To help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had `` Big '' Miller , as a preacher-singer and Hannah Dean , Gospel-singer , while Oscar Brown Jr. , an extremely talented young man , did a slave auctioneer's call , a field-hands' work song , and a beautifully sung Negro lullaby , `` Brown Baby '' , which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival .

Mr. Nagrin has described four `` places '' , each with its scenery and people , added two `` diversions '' , and concluded with `` A Toccata for the Young '' , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing .

Highly successful in England before its transfer to New York , most of `` Roots '' is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy .
Only in its final scene , where Beatie Bryant ( Mary Doyle ) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts .
The New York Shakespeare Festival , which is using the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed , began bravely .
A voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes .
`` Much Ado '' ends happily .
One could hardly blame Newbold Morris , the Parks Commissioner , for devoting so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains .
Eldon Elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood .
All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; ;
On Saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved .
There was , additionally , a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons .
Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn , who danced the `` Nutcracker '' pas de deux , were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas de deux from `` Don Quixote '' , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely .
This somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' , a collection of travel essays by William Sansom , who would never consider staying home for long .
Mr. Sansom is English , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between .
There are sixteen essays in `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' .
He ignores guidebook facts .
tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears '' ; ;
after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity '' .
Unfortunately , `` Poised For Violence '' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point .
But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words .
good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration .
A weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month .
The show is programed and written by the station's assistant continuity editor , Chuck Briefer .
So , for that matter , are the newer dances -- the `` Kalmuk Dance '' with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called `` The Platter '' , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` Summer '' , `` The Three Shepherds '' of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of course , the trenchant `` Rock 'n' Roll '' .
in fact , a freezing autumn dulls the blaze .
In the Canadian Rockies , great groves of aspen are already glinting gold .
The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October , choice routes being 9N from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake Placid area .
Farther south in New York there is a heavy haze of color over the Catskills in mid-October , notably along routes 23 and 23A .
The most brilliant displays are along the Skyline Drive above Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and throughout the Great Smokies between North Carolina and Tennessee .
The `` peacock tail '' nozzle throws a giant fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high .
Carson McCullers , after a long , painful illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul , has come back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller lists even before official publication .
This retelling by Louis Zara of the brief , anguished life of Stephen Crane -- poet and master novelist at 23 , dead at 28 -- is in novelized form but does not abuse its tragic subject .
Shore facilities are enormous -- Los Angeles harbors 5,000 boats , and Long Beach 3,000 -- but marinas are crowded everywhere .
the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate .
Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement , Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe , and a modicum of automobile racing .
the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming ; ;
The Italian master Piero Taruffi , no less sensitive , knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae .
Never given to mincing words , he places heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America .
The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad .
As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead .
`` But where is the leader who will handle all these things for us '' ? ?
Like Eisenhower , he holds the militarist's suspicion of politicians .
For the most part , his writing rambles and jogs , preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts .
Nevertheless , Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world .
And in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American interest in how what people eat affects their health .
From the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the U.S. has progressed to curds , concentrates and capsules .
The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime K ( for Keys ) ration and author of last year's bestselling Eat Well And Stay Well .
Already many an American knows his count , and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ) .
The deficiency diseases -- scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra -- run rampant .
Today , as Harrison's Principles Of Internal Medicine , a standard internist's text , puts it , `` The most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity '' .
Morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him .
Some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment .
The result says Jolliffe : `` The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life '' .
What concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation's No. 1 killer : coronary artery disease , which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500,000 Americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents .
Cholesterol , the cornerstone of Dr. Keys's theory , is a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol .
They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones .
They suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system .
Eventually , says Keys , one of two things happens .
When the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours .
Although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever .
The situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible , which deals with the Salem witch trials .
We are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false .
And his belief is not to his discredit .
Spirit and community
Think , for example , of the spirit of the Marine Corps .
Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge .
One characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .
But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .
But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?
Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?
In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; ;
In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .
In any case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen , even in Devonshire and Cornwall , where anti-Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .
A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948 '' .
And in the last five years , the `` Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or , more often , the sale of 764 chapels '' .
I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics .
The English saints are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized .
Some Catholic priests lecture there ; ;
Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs , sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen .
And it was interesting to observe that B.B.C.'s television film on Christmas Eve was The Bells Of St. Mary's .
Christ is both unique and universal .
Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals , but as universal human beings , who were and are all of humanity .
There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement : `` If the ( Holy ) Spirit is absent from the soul , such a man is indeed of an animal nature ; ;
`` Eve was disobedient ; ;
Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children , Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness , but still wicked '' .
he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath .
This idea , which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian , fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology ; ;
This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians , especially the Greek-speaking ones .
On the other hand , Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence .
If death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share , the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal , i.e. , created , existence .
Furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes .
Suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel : is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ? ?
It has been endlessly rephrased , but I may here put it thus : at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant ? ?
He arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at the least , resentment .
What otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters '' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' Holy , holy , holy is the Almighty Dollar ' `` ? ?
`` If it gave me pleasure to say hard things '' , he wrote , `` I would shut up forever '' .
It has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this .
Here I took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to which we might give the modern name of Pragmatism , or the thing that works .
I discern no limits to a faith vested in God and Christ , who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and daring to trust Him even though called to stand alone before the world .
That is why the Bible commands you to `` Taste and see that the Lord is good : blessed ( happy ) is the man that trusteth in Him '' ( Psalm 34 : 8 ) .
whom shall I fear ? ?
We consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart .
Suppose we do get our fears out in the open , what then ? ?
Meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can .
It could have the same effect on Communists .
whom shall I fear ? ?
Practically everybody in Berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city .
We live from crisis to crisis .
He lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark .
he could only see the light coming over the horizon .
If God could do that , He could do anything .
The apostle Paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the New Testament : `` He that spared not His own Son , but delivered Him up for us all , how shall He not with Him freely give us all things ? ?
Salvation ! !
But , again , we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century A.D. , when an Arabic scholar , Tabit Ibn Korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three .
Thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis .
This trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest ; ;
And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four ? ?
while the Yin , or female principle , flourished in darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the Moon .
During the Han dynasty , another Yin-Yang conception was applied to the Lo Shu , considering the latter as a plan of Ancient China .
The same arrangement was used when the Lo Shu was equated with the Nine Provinces ; ;
The pastor and the Membership Preparation and Assimilation Committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program .
The atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience .
8 )
the church is `` the family of God '' .
Every member of the family must have a vital place in its life .
One denomination had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at 1,541,991 -- a net growth of only 122,158 .
Those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest .
-- Social and recreational activities
Care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands .
Massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender .
to escape this fate , it must rule some things out .
Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows .
What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history ? ?
To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us .
Africans and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda .
I turn finally to several theological developments .
During the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the Sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties .
Especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited .
If we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following `` simple test '' : `` Have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are '' ? ?
Thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ; ;
But one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense , or a static order in which no changes will take place in time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force .
On their way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation .
Hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop '' .
Here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .
Realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc. .
There is some reality to this ; ;
Realtors , both generally and in this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension .
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage .
( 3 ) Over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed .
Our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other .
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook .
We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music .
And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith .
You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima .
For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days .
Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; ;
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia .
So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are .
A speck -- and space
Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing .
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; ;
So if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; ;
The form of Christianity to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of the older stock , for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration ; ;
We will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards , and through leaders in the government .
In the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration .
We must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them Melville , Hawthorne , and Henry James the elder , all of them out of a Christian background .
Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism .
Quakers , some from New England , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted .
For example , in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply .
The anti-slavery movement took many forms .
Wendell Phillips ( 1811-1884 ) , from a prominent Massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of Lyman Beecher .
By swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons .
If the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine .
It was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality .
The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation ; ;
Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman .
To live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate .
Reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap .
`` Why '' , said the teacher , `` art thou so late '' ? ?
The need of the new birth
The new birth is necessary because god is holy .
Therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death , and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned .
You also , when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins .
As many as received him were born of God .
If we are born of God we love God .
He who does not love abides in death .
I am convinced of this , that he who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of Christ Jesus .
If then any man is in Christ , he is a new creature ( literally , `` He is a new creation ) , the former things have passed away ; ;
For by grace you have been saved through faith ; ;
1 St. John 12 .
The new birth is the impartation of the divine nature .
And the life that I now live in the flesh , I live in the faith of the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself up for me .
But to as many as received him he gave the power of becoming sons of God ; ;
St. John 12 , 13 .
God withheld His wrath .
You can laugh at His blood-bought salvation , curse His followers , and laugh at hell .
The choice is yours : the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with God ; ;
The choice is yours : God is in your hands , now .

Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa , once spending a week with Dr. Albert Schweitzer .
I am sure that Castro was happy , too , about that support .
He spent long hours before the TV spitting out promises of revenge .

Pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun .
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care .
We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; ;
That keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing .

Here then is our problem : aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing ; ;
Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life .
We have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 Aj .
Today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc. .
Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor .
Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity .
And although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications .

Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original .
The Presto Ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro con Spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet .
The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality .

No matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the Southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake Texoma , located between Texas and Oklahoma , which resulted when the Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River .
And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago .
There is no question as to just what is available .
You name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models .
Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat .
American technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American boating .
Now here is truly a marvel .
Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances .
When the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go .

In 1959 , the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment .
Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas .
In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves .
If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time .
Two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar .
Interlocking signals are normally at stop or `` red '' position , and a lever must be pulled to `` clear '' the signal .
Each diagram is accompanied by a `` dog chart '' , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled .
`` Home '' signals have two blades .
Our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction .
Position these using six intermediate temporary Af spacers and locate the upper 12'' '' bar `` A '' .
To find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge .
Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4'' '' tappet movement .
File to a smooth finish .
The equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem .
They indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition .
For example , for the problem Af , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 .
Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order .
The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart .
It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly .
Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine's total displacement .
The formula is : Af .
Dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches .
Do not overfill the chamber .
Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber .
However , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters .
The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch .

About a thousand years after that , when the Roman Empire was divided , it became capital of the Eastern section .
Start of tour
Across the bridge on the left I saw St. Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque .
On the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square , with Yeni Cami , or the New Mosque , which dates from the Seventeenth Century , just across from the entrance to the bridge .
Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of Crusaders .
Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed the street , entered the Hippodrome , and walked ahead to the Obelisk of Theodosius , originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B.C. by Thutmose , who also built those now in New York , London and Rome at the Lateran .
Beyond it I noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the Serpentine Column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi , Greece .
It stands in the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine , who brought it from Rome .
I stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , Bayezit , with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it .
After lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet , flaky cake -- in Istanbul .

Use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking .
If clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers .
No bisque firing .

To insert markers :
Place sleeve seam at center underarm and center of sleeve cap at shoulder seam .
Weaving seam
to weave seams together :
Straight vertical edges , such as those at the back seam of a sock , can be woven together invisibly .
Hold edges together , right side up .
All are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern .
Therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc. , on a table saw .
Be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required .
The first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames .
Placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens .
The chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending .
This can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long .
Then it is replaced and fastened .

`` It consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore .
As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature ; ;
It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth , Haverhill , and Philadelphia .

This second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway .
It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on U.S. Route 250 -- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike .
Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts .
We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards .
We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks .
So rules we made , in unabashed collusion .
Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners .
Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times .
A gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard .
We also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille .
In many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet .
They are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements .

Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes .
Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania .
You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house .
Its upkeep ? ?
The need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent .
If you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later .
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed .
The heat pump .
Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling .
Before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low .
A shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money .
Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling .
Keeping conditioners quiet .
The same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use .
What are the existing recreation features ? ?
A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic .
Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value .
The fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest .
Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas .
Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites .
-- How much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? ?
In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native land .
Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism -- producing music for the masses .
One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous .
Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World -- not his experimentations .
When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures .
With a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children's fairy tales -- Slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large .

That his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it .
Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures .
After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand .
During all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods .
Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- Roy developed his art by himself .
In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created .
rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia .
He was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 .

Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself .
If we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it .
To be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance .
It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side .

We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry .
When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering .
The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities .
By combining the talents of a medical man , Dr. Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr. Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr. Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes .
This assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry .
At the University of Washington Medical School , the electronics group has developed the `` Respiratory Gas Analyzer '' shown in Fig. 3 .
Heart-measuring techniques
The latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow .
A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2 .
Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers .
Battery life limited the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum .
The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' .
Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments .
He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma .
Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching .
From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects .
Hans' student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent .
Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left .
He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood .
It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , Lauritz Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow .
In the late 1700's Beccaria and Van Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it .
At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle .
In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name .

Increases gains , improves feed efficiency , and reduces losses from bacterial infections listed under `` How To Feed '' section .
How to feed : beef
For cows , feed providing an intake of 0.1 milligram of Aureomycin per pound of body weight daily aids in the reduction of bacterial diarrhea , in the prevention of foot rot , and in the reduction of losses due to respiratory infection ( infectious rhinotracheitis -- shipping fever complex ) .
Dynafac .
-- 0.2 gram Dynafac per head daily ( 1 gram of premix per head daily ) for promoting growth , feed conversion , bloom , and full feed earlier .
How to feed : beef cattle
-- 10 milligrams of diethylstilbestrol per head daily .
Sheep fattening rations

Not less than milligram but not more than 1.25 milligrams of additive per pound of body weight .
There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle : ( 1 ) Fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons ; ;
( 2 ) Mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ;
Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk .

Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs. .
Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs. ? ?
Increased customer sophistication .
The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted .
In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade .
Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on .
There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain .
Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ?
In your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? ?
Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ?
Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R & D people ? ?
Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? ?
Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis .
If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade .

And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society .
It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects .
One technical question of school organization comes to mind here .
Only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations .
General
When improvements are recommended in working conditions -- such as lighting , rest rooms , eating facilities , air-conditioning -- do you try to set a measure of their effectiveness on productivity ? ?
Have you publicized the cents-per-hour value of the company's share of insurance premiums ? ?
Are your expenses in this area commensurate with the number of employees who benefit from your program ? ?
If you use company transportation to meet trains or to haul visitors , would taxis be cheaper ? ?
Which is more economical for your plant -- a vacation shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra employees for vacation fill-ins ? ?
Is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually costing your plant money ? ?
Will your union accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees ? ?
Use deductable insurance wherever feasible .
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age .
A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires .
Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay .
This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New York staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .
Considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach .
Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation .
The first program was sponsored by Abraham & Strauss , Hempstead , New York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis .
The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand .

Are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?
There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .
This means either cars or trucks .
the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers ; ;
There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below .
A volume market
And it's far from the end for plastics .
Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction .
a 3-by-6-ft. plastic sign weighs about 120 lb. , compared to 275-300 lb. for neon .

Changeable letters fill many needs
Finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) .
Finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in .
Instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) .
Says Clarence Thompson : `` We dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself '' .
`` So from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing '' .
`` It made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling .
Says NRLDA's James Wright : `` Since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's other equipment '' .
Even `` America's most efficient builder '' , Bob Schmitt of Berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works .
A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages .
The champagne at Troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'Argent .
Rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of Europe .
Quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country .
In the majority of countries , however , the rates range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger , luxury European models , with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $.03 and going up as high as $.12 .
The same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven .
It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be .
Since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine .
Of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac limousine just for you and your bride , you'll have a memorable tour , but it won't be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes .
In American romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called `` meeting cute '' -- that is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom .
And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture .
In a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words .
In one now-historic first interview , for example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes ) goes like this : The therapist's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has , for example , avoided stressing `` you '' , which would imply disapproval ; ;
By saying `` another emotional death '' , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words .
When someone says , for example , `` They took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me '' , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made .
She was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name .

After the first two were blacked out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until British MP's shot it out .
There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement .
You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before .
Occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude .
The basic mystery of dreams , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream , is in the fact that they are original , visual continuities .
For instance , the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and , with photographic realism , sees Smith driving the car ; ;
Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components , including that weird feeling of deja vue , inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem .
It is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever-existent past-fantasy future .
We may conclude that all six points of information , ostensibly given by the dream priest , could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning .
When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the most important phase , the educational opportunities .
To him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind .
By 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray .
Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells .
The garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar .
The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread .
It is well liked by the children and faculty .
There is one problem with the bread .
`` Lillian's bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much '' , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds .
Vegetables are served liberally .
Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark , `` Lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today '' ? ?
The school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef cattle for most of their needs .
Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility .
For deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week .
Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm .
To solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains .
Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds .

Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday , November 4 , 1927 , when officials of the Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight .
The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord , N. H. .
There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont .
Though the makeshift airports were ready , the York State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule .
In Concord , Bob Fogg was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings .
Sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover , Red Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed , and his pilot , Lt. Franklin Wolfe , badly injured .
Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station .
Out at the airport each morning , Fogg's skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar .
When driving rain or mist socked in one valley , Fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes .
The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on these trips .
It ticked over smoothly , idling while Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen , and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St. John field .
Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems .
Tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet .
How did I get to be sixty-five so fast ? ?
Suddenly , one day , up it pops ! !
It is the way you were taught and your way of life .
All this is standard equipment for a man of your day ; ;
You realize you are getting in the old fogy class .
The answer is a new era .
Conferences become very popular .
Some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments .
Well , whatever you have , that's it ! !
The question is `` How are you going to live with it '' ? ?
It seems to me , the first thing you've got to do , to be happy , is to face up to your problems , no matter what they may be .
One thing , I am sure of , you must get an interest in life .
Then again , there's always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs .
I can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's where it belongs .
Don't be discouraged ! !
When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual .
`` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' .
While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .
This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .
By this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .
The consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose .
The hymen is , in essence , a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations .
Often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse .
Extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated .
These cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds .
In recent times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention .
Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride ? ?
The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control .
In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl .
Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value .
Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin .
Now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire .
It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role .
It can , in fact , wreck a marriage .
On the other hand , wifely supremacy demeans the husband , saps his self-respect , and robs him of his masculinity .
To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .
Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife's mercy .
When was the turning point ? ?
Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .
She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .
A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well '' .
One such wife , Dr. Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .
Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title , prostitute .
And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 , `` Diane Harris Graham , 30 , D.O.A. , circumstances -- unusual '' .
`` In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County .
She lied in order to get it .
I never gave that boy a cent .
She teamed up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious .
`` There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom : Miss Harrington ( this was Diane's choice for a Roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors .
She thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in Rome , she met Pulley Bey , a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt .
Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key .
It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio's , an excellent Italian restaurant .
When he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and then the police .
Police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her .
As he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body , Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo .
`` You have it , all right .
He urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300 .
He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine .
An isolated case of quackery ? ?
Rather , it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment of serious diseases .
With these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs , ticks , and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game , capitalizing on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age .
That's why the FDA , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) , and the National Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually .
Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her .
As a result , she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack `` doctor '' was using were phony .
And there was the case of Tom Hepker , a machinist , who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine .
His prescription : hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water .
By no means are these isolated cases .
Says Wallace F. Jannsen , director of the FDA's Division of Public Information : `` Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people , or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis , rheumatism , diabetes , and cancer .
The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people , like Mr. A. , who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor Fraud's avarice .
Ten-year-old Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year .
Malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need to look out for .
A child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions :
The eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs .
If baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place .
Yet from the dentist's point of view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons .
The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system .
Because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition .
The when and how of straightening
`` most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55 '' , says Dr. Brodie .
What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's office ? ?
As the tooth moves , bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve , and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved .
During these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth .
The charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country .
Research helps families
The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in this drama must be separated .
As always , a tape recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter .
If you look at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at all ! !
`` A journey '' , `` a little white house '' , `` a change of outlook '' , can apply to many people .
The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions .

Livestock must be tended every day , routinely .
Production may fall far below expectations .
Drought , hail , disease , and insects take their toll of crops .
For some retired persons , part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income .
Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 .
Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use , and for a small flock of chickens , a cow , and two pigs .
You could not , of course , raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small .
The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision .
Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development .
Labor
You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing , however .
You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery , by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor , and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs .
Selecting a farm
Location
Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road .
--
Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise ? ?
How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ? ?
If the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed , check into the cost of making these improvements .
Take into account the difference in city and county taxes , insurance rates , utility rates , and the cost of travel to work .
To do this , set up a plan on paper for operating the farm .
Public relations strategists everywhere , watching the reaction of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic-fringe press , listening to their neighbors , studying interviews with men and women on the street , cried out : Too much , too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled , the horrors are losing their effect .
Those who feared `` emotionalism '' at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies .
Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial .
It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe .
It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; ;
In Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , , in 1952 , a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff .
The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level .
Instead of emotional recrimination , loaded phrases and sloganeering , we need a dispassionate study of the facts , a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached .
Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used .
The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end .
This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain `` given '' physical arrangements .
Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature , Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws , not frustrate or mock them .
It is always a temptation for a religious organization , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others .
With the return of our soldiers , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens .
Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage .
The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman .
For hundreds of years , the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain's fragmentary journal , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors , ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man's desk on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports .
In 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .
On the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case .
Fog hung over the route constantly .
A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther .
One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds , he would give ninety of them to be back in England .
The ship halted .
This was the bitter end , and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure .
Hands on Bible , seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins .
Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea hit the ship .
Having achieved this end , he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers .
Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire .
For many years the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie Du Chien on the Mississippi River , some 300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul , Minnesota .
When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States , its British-born employees , now become American citizens -- Joseph Rolette , Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly -- continued in the fur business .
They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills .
During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England .
''
Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round .
Bailly , after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse `` in the Sieux Country '' and reached Fort Garry , as the Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called , late in the fall .
In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June .
By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States .
In 1837 , 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling .
Below the fort , high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River .
A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas on a rawhide '' .
She is well-educated and refined , all wildcat and fur , and Union from the muzzle to the crupper '' .
Humor found many modes of expression .
William R. Stillwell , an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department of Archives and History , liked to tease his wife in his letters .
Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as `` looseness of the bowels '' ; ;
I eat too much eggs and poark .
The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances .
A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed his mother : `` I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter .
Some of the letters were pungently expressive .
Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers .
On December 9 , 1862 , Sergeant Edwin H. Fay , an unusual Louisianan who held A.B. and M.A. degrees from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in Louisiana , wrote his wife : `` I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw .
His head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment , much less a corps .
In America , such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose .
In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage , the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this .
That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant .
Anthropologists , housewives , historians and such by profession , they approach their discipline as amateurs , collectors , commercial propagandists , analysts or some combination of the four .
The amateur is closely related to the collector , who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field .
The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; ;
and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located .
The commercial propagandist , who can't afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine .
To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul , lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications .
And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone .
Does the writer know the difference between an `` ersatz '' ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk ? ?
In the second place , a large number of writers , making a more direct claim than Frost to being `` folk writers '' of one sort or another , clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material .
He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-Examiner as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors .
The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time .
Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor , the proprieter of a Loop gambling house .
In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking .
They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as , when his bodyguard , Yankee Schwartz , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller , a prize-fight referee , chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation , who were Hirschey , a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion , Frank , a policeman , and Max , the youngest .
O'Banion's reaction was : `` Three hundred dollars ! !
But in the meantime the beer-runner , unhappy with this solution , telephoned Torrio and returned to O'Banion with the message : `` Say , Dionie , I just been talking to Johnny , and he said to let them cops have the three hundred .
When , as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election , Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero , the profits from that district had been $20,000 a month .
its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast .
In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ; ;
While a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour , the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour .
A tsunami is not a single wave but a series .
On some of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently ; ;
In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high .
The warning system immediately went into action .

The restless earth and its interior
Chandler understood this and expected the worst .
But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises , beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early .
He not only knew soldiering , but mathematics , history and literature as well .
For example , it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn .
The troopers knew an attack was coming , but they didn't know when , and they didn't know where .
Then it came , against Troop Aj .
They came in waves .
He assembled a group of 25 men , composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation , the company clerk , supply men , cooks and drivers , and led them to the hill .
But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously .
But the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding fell dead .
Artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds .
Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn , about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history , that the 7th Cavalry first made its mark in history , the regiment was ten years old by then .
and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States .
I submit that this is the key problem of international relations , that it always has been , that it always will be .
the other , for the most part , true .
and even then , it is a concept that can be highly misleading .
The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead .
Today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist ; ;
Laos is teetering between Communism and pro-Communist neutralism ; ;
Indonesia , in the early days of the Republic , leaned toward the West .
A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve .
In some countries the trend has gone further than others : Mexico , Panama , and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism , and there is no country -- save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where Castroism and Anti-Americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause .

When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant , the boy answered , `` It's the same thing '' .
Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple .
However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy , professing to believe in Judaism `` but in a moderate way '' .
The older teens
The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys .
Typically , in a lower-middle class Jewish family , a son will be sent to an out-of-town school , if financial resources warrant it , while the daughter will attend the local college .
`` It's people of your own kind '' , a girl remarked .
It is significant that the Catskills , which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers , a kind of summer suburb of New York , no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters , bus boys , or counselors in the day camps .

When he heard of his brothers' anger , Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages .
If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery , they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited .
This cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper , devoid of compassion or humanity , was all he needed .
Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150 ; ;
Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen Negroes , and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66 .

The New Bedford Standard-Times has reported Knowlton as saying , long after the trial , that if he only knew what Borden said during his conversation with Morse , he would have convicted `` somebody '' .
He said he would have convicted `` somebody '' .
He said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar .
The woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner .
Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi .
Questioned further , Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him .
She said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs. Borden told her to wash the windows .
He knew the house fairly well , he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone .
And despite Knowlton's attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum , this was not true .
Mrs. Borden would not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand .
Mrs. Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out .
There was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains , and certainly no scientific test was made of them .

There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind .
A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate , Albert S. Flint , friend of her brother Winslow , and later , like Winslow , a noted astronomer .
When her brother Winslow became a student at Brown University in 1874 , she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under Professor Diman : `` What is Prof. Diman's definition of civilization , and take the world through , is its progress ever onward , or does it retrograde at times ? ?
'' And that she proceeded to do .
Mathematics came next '' .
As a matter of fact , Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that `` her physical strength , her mental power , her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings '' would have led her `` to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country '' .
They were not sufficiently challenging however , and she resigned in 1887 , to go to Germany with her brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study .
Here was a cause she believed in .
Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students ; ;
of `` her exquisiteness of dress '' , `` her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers '' ; ;
Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; ;
she died on August sixth .
Quiet and energetic , cheerful and calm , she too was a power in the development of the seminary .
Miss Giles always used to refer to her as `` Sister '' .
He receives remuneration for his work .
But in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent .
Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools .
This is a problem to which leaders of opinion , both Negro and white , should devote far more attention .
This last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .
In my view , there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city .
I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes .
In the United States , where half of the world crop is grown , soybeans are processed for their edible oil .
We produce peanut oil , but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed .
Cereal grains , supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans , comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa .
More than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock .
Palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin .
Starch is used in the paper , textile , and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations .
Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners , stabilizers , or dispersing agents .
The oil palm of West Africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit .
Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons .
Sesame seed , which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt , Brazil , and Central America , has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds .
The farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes , including the cereals , is nearly 10 billion dollars a year .
That became their `` home range '' .
Drifts usually happened only with cattle , for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 'em , and to find shelter for 'emselves .
When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to `` come out a-stoopin' '' .
They were said to be `` on their heads '' when grazin' .
A general classification given grass-fed cattle was `` grassers '' .
When cattle became more valuable , ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued , at least when the boss was 'round .
Seizin' the bull by the tail , he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side , throwin' the bull off balance , and `` bustin' '' 'im with terrific force .
Colors of cattle came in for their special names .
A `` mealynose '' was a cow or steer of the longhorn type , with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest of its body 'round the eyes , face , and nose .
Near the southern border , cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback , with white speckles frequently appearin' on the sides and belly , were called `` zorrillas '' .
`` That's the Colonel '' , he said , `` But I can't see the dogs '' .
As they watched , Jones rode straight for the Reef .
Careful , don't disturb her '' .
Her roar changed to a growl .
Jones yelled , `` or she'll kill 'em all .
Called out Means as she ran .
`` Don't you go a step nearer her than I do '' , Jones warned , `` and if you do , go at a run so you'll have momentum '' ! !
John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind , many of them trailing blood .
Enough , was the answer .
But Means kept on .
The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .
As things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main Street in the nation .
Most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .
The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation , but Hinduism , Buddhism , Islam , Confucianism , Taoism , Shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love .
What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes .
Its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .
And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .
As the twenties grew older , and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals , the great hitters ( always led by Babe Ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account .
Boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to `` choke up '' on a bat as Willie Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done .
A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities , with the encouragement of the press , so that they might see their names in big black print , along with Daddy Browning's , Al Capone's , Earl Sande's , and the Prince of Wales' .
And while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year , stars now were asking ten thousand dollars , twenty thousand dollars , yes , even fifty thousand dollars a season .
Ruth himself , still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers , had led the parade down from Fenway Park , followed by pitchers Carl Mays , Leslie `` Joe '' Bush , Waite Hoyt , Herb Pennock , and Sam Jones , catcher Wally Schang , third baseman Joe Dugan ( who completed the `` playboy trio '' of Ruth , Dugan , and Hoyt ) , and shortstop Everett Scott .
In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced , and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring .
This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies , some of which began to offer special excursion rates , including seats at the park , just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new .
This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the `` ideal '' , and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal .
Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations , in her adolescence , of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame , if not guilt , for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to , and judged by , the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends .
but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self .
These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs , for experimenting with many roles , and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities .
They attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ; ;
The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals .
This tendency is , perhaps , most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents .
A pronounced ideological diffusion -- i.e. , inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways .
It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans , whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment .
In the adult world , there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis .
In the final accounting , these would have augmented the bill for both sides .
The duration and other circumstances of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions .
the duplication of testimony and exhibits ; ;
One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among A.L.A.M. members .
Within its limits , this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement .
At this point Charles C. Hanch , long an advocate of patent peace in the industry , became chairman of the patents committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce , successor to the Automobile Board of Trade .
Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry , Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.L.A.M. members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan .
The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal , but Hanch did not abandon his scheme .
`` It is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned '' , said a trade authority , `` than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system , which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day '' .
The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association .
The remains of the Portico of Octavia are now in front of you .
The sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front .

He knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way .
One day , to everyone's astonishment , someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up .
I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South .
This is precisely what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is , as I write , being fought out all up and down those streets .
They seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War , and won , they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South , without taking any responsibility for it ; ;
I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners , because `` At least there , you haven't got to play any guessing games '' ! !
I know another Negro , a man very dear to me , who says , with conviction and with truth , `` The spirit of the South is the spirit of America '' .
The world has never lacked for horrifying examples ; ;
He never sees Negroes .
It seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many Negroes , comparatively , bought Cadillacs last year and how few , comparatively , were lynched ) , or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ) .
I was curious to know if Lumumba's death , which is surely among the most sinister of recent events , would elicit from `` our '' side anything more than the usual , well-meaning rhetoric .
The answer to both questions is immediately obvious .
It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult , implying , as it does , that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated .
An early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary , Queen Of Scots .
In response , the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day .
The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men , a French magician , Georges Melies , and an American employee of Edison , Edwin S. Porter .
The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely .
The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film .
The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ; ;
He revealed the potential value of the `` cut '' as the basic technique in the art of the film .
Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented .
Members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; ;
it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship .
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers .
consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; ;
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; ;
this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes .
The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded , and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships .
In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony .
Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River .
It was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west , principally down the Arkansas River .
On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post `` at the fork of two great rivers '' .
Only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at Mobile , the other at New Orleans .
Their territory lay to the north , near the sources of the Alabama , the Tombigbee , the Tennessee , and Cumberland rivers , and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees .
But the Company of the Indies , holding to its program of economy , made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices .
To the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy .
He asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts .
It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade .
Bienville , who returned to succeed Perier in 1732 , objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits .
First , the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters .
In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson .
Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats , Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way .
Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington .
Where his predecessors had glowered , Menshikov smiled .
`` This is where I get my information from '' , he confided .

`` Do you mean to tell us '' , a reporter asked , `` that the King has twenty-one children , twenty-five of whom are sons '' ? ?
The reports of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats , including the Israeli Foreign Minister , Mrs. Golda Meir .
Finally he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli concessions .
The deep water is used by many people , but it is always clean , for the washing is done outside .
Of course , most toilets are Eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height , they are actually outside toilets -- inside .
They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning .
With the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan , the people are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings that have strength .
There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability .
They suggested several new foods , and usually I found them good , except the sweets , which I think I could learn to like .
They understood and teased me a bit about it .
In Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon .
In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima .
I was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience .
A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima .

This day was `` Open House for Parents '' day , and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables .
At this Women's University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that Japanese women also should be educated .
Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings .

Graduates of this maid's school are much in demand and can always find work immediately .
Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled , and to legal remedies .
and again , that `` the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely , to demoralize the opponent , to break his will , to destroy his confidence , enthusiasm , and hope .
In another respect it is dissimilar , for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values '' .
Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement , we must certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any form of resistance , and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance .
and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means , and apply to both alike , justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action .
There must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance , violent or non-violent .
We may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above .
I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience .
'' This , for the liberals I know , would be an understatement .
Also , we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence .
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination .
In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country .
Whatever their faults , they are not hypocrites .
Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally .
This was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires .
National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations .
Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists , a body of lawyers from the free world , the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties .
For better or for worse , we all now live in welfare states , the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being .
If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism .
These fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power .
In fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined .
Their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures -- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions .
In recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration , basic United States strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible .
Multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible .

Suddenly one of them shouted , ran a few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground .
With a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows .
There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not .

Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died .
He knows that the economy of life in the `` outback '' is awful .

It was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets .
The Australian and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine .
The boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes .

And of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar .
Water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form -- these things are important to Persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness .
The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses .

Die Frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr , the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times .
Yes : though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family .
When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale .
Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra , and during World War 1 , , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as well .
During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera .
In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United States , by way of Switzerland .
Since it is not far from Viareggio , he will visit Puccini's house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme , which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces .

When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly .
Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them .
That test , as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message , will determine `` whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure '' .
Strong men with strong opinions , frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences .
Author of the Albany Plan Of Union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the Revolution , he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London , negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war , headed the state government of Pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention .
He served as president of the Continental Congress .
Hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet .
`` As an independent American I considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack '' .
The latter in turn assured him that `` were I arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause '' .
Indeed , the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats .
of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; ;
But the South is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly enough , is not reflected in its literature .
the list is , obviously , endless .
Where are the writers to treat these changes ? ?
Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South , which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context , this new coat of paint .
Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the buses ; ;
He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws .
and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare .
Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century .
No Southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick , Dreiser , and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New York .
Faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County , the gradual changes which seep into the South , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way .
The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure .
The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies .
Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development .
But a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching , the Chinese Book Of Changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials .
The process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it .
The design is determined emotionally : `` I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me '' .
In his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the `` first revealed stroke of its existence '' , states the theme from which all else must follow .
Events occur without apparent reason .
And so I would only touch upon it now ( much as I have long wanted to write a book about it ) .

'' The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term .
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens .
After the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union .
To my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error , and in all our error , some truth .
Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man .
As cells coalesced into organisms , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world .
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit , composed of people , which gives us both some immunity from , and a way of dealing with , other people .
We are desperately in the need of such invention , for man is still very much at the mercy of man .
I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science , the connection between scientific understanding and fear .
There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears .
They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world , but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group .
Yet often fear persists because , even with the most rigid ritual , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act .
A meteor could fall on San Francisco .
Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought .
Our weapons production , our world prestige , our ideas of democracy , our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage ? ?
We use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as `` trust '' , `` cheat '' , and `` get tough '' .
In addition , our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed .
In some areas , the progress is slower than in others .
Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease .
Nothing like Godot , he arrived before the hour .
But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism .

Hemingway's fiction is supported by a `` moral '' backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension .
Lawrence Lipton , in The Holy Barbarians , stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure ; ;
For this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy .
This is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat '' .
Thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to `` religious '' metaphors : they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion .
He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth .
With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm .
And the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive , even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing , painting , music .
Who are the creative representatives of this movement ? ?
They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony .
Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana .
As Lipton puts it : `` The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms .

The horse plodded on , and he repeated his call .
the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk , from sidewalk to lawn .
Opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step , set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse .
The wife , Amra , and her lover are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief maker '' , with `` a kind of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity , her `` birdlike brain '' .
In the work of every artist , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; ;
When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance , I come up with the following ideas , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay .
Professionally a lawyer , that is to say associated with dignity , reserve , discipline , with much that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised -- that is , paradoxically , revealed -- as a child , and , worse , as a whore masquerading as a child .
that is to say , to the churchyard '' .
The cyclist , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow , is not named but identified simply as `` Life '' -- that and a license number , which Piepsam uses in addressing him .
The cyclist , by contrast , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life , `` blithe and carefree '' .
But he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad to watch him , more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist .
The monk Savonarola , brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century , protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of M. Bluthenzweig ; ;
And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art , their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance , new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written .
The mimetic imagination in the arts
He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped .
Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience , in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself .
The images themselves , like their counterparts in experience , are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; ;
These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice .
In contrast to all this , primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers .
Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding , for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail , is initially given in the way man feels the world .
I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years ago , during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg .
But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ) , the improvement was impaired .
They didn't seem to be able to think of any .
The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history .
The Declaration of Independence says that `` governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed '' .
The phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look .
Calhoun dealt with this question in his `` Disquisition On Government '' .
That regional peculiarities do not still exist ? ?
Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .
If there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood , there's always New England .
And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction .
It is something which most of us try to get out from under .
He also spoke of `` the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil '' .
Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade .
Who is the owner ? ?
Like Pilate , they had washed their hands .
The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .
The New England conscience became desensitized .
He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools .
Professor Fredrik Book , Sweden's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows : `` In this we have the verse of a painter ; ;
he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus .
On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection .
The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled , says the wife , her husband has achieved immortality .
Not so , he answers , it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal .
`` The man's true reputation is his work '' .
He did not , however , find himself at once .
His next major work , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic in prose , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth .
He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .
on the fatal battlefield of Poltava , to quote from the novel , `` the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people '' .
The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories , each depicting a special phase of the general subject .
This comes out in `` When The Bells Ring '' , which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes .
It is different with his volume The Swedes And Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras Hovdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students .
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof .
Gustaf Vasa is a superb example , and Charles 10 , , the conqueror of Denmark , hardly less so .
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases , but his primary function remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not .
On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency , but is almost always self-employed .
It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective .
Not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth to monopoly capitalism .
Even on the fictional level , however , the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved .
he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ; ;
he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast .
More profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe .
In either case , they do not appreciate the private detective's zeal .
Frequently enough , the police are themselves in league with the killer ; ;
What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite .
By upholding his own personal code of behavior , the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption .
If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards , he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society .
He must , in short , cease to be a detective and become a rebel .
In order to save the mystery story , they have converted the private detective into an organization man .
It will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required , because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in Table 1 .
This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question , but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car .
This , and other qualifications , make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up .
Looking at the diagram , we see that Af connection lines come in to each member .
In any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors , a point like f in Figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader , while e and h would house the next most important citizens .
Location theorists have given these matters much consideration .
All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks .
This monitoring is necessary because , on a parade ground , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event would develop .
Not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare , where the surveillance , sending , transmitting , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks .
Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach .
American democratic thought , pointed up the relation between the Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion , which he called the American Democratic Faith .
Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 .
It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man .
The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion of Humanity , however , prepared the way for a reception of the French Revolution's socialistic offspring of one sort of another .
The importance of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us , however .
A perceptive journalist , Sam Lubell , has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates .
He opens his discourse , however , with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents , all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age .
The show was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny .
It has moved on various levels , it has been clamorous and confused .
One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election , I suppose , is that we , the majority , were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism .
I suppose we might classify Billy Graham as an old liberal .
And I would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- sang in one key or another the same song .
Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower ? ?
Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? ?
Noting such evidence is the first step ; ;
We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else .
Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies .
But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America , foreigners can ; ;
If we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it .
As a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in `` swallowing '' creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .
In all other areas , private initiative of the `` proprietorship '' type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services .
and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests .
Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot .
This combined experience , on a foundation of very average , I assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against .
From an initial investment of $1,200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000 ( we don't disclose financial figures to the public ) .
Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails .
Hence , the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion , unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe .
Despite the clarity of his presentation , his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre .
The Jews had been banished from England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years .
If any had escaped expulsion by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place .
It would have been unwise policy , for instance , to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman .
Are we better off for having Shakespeare's idea of Shylock ? ?
he is out of place in our times .
For answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists , the biologists , the historians , the psychologists , and the sociologists .
Debate in the political arena can be productive of good .
The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the President's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral , rather than a medical , problem .
It recurred in the press conferences : the President's remarks about his running developed a singular tone , one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter .
The press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking , rather than his convictions .
Yet the attitude that the fate of the Presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought , regardless of the consequences .
In this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears .
But by the time the risk was doubled , events had dismissed from his mind both increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza .
What is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the laws of human probability , whether or not it is later confirmed , has become by September of the election year `` a firm conviction '' .
Only recently , and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary mastery of detail , have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of politics .
and it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual's command of language interacts with the other two .
The liberal-conservative division , we might observe in passing , is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups .
Rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man's life in society .
Of all forms of being , society , or community , has the greatest element of determinability .
Civilization is what man has made of himself .
This happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself , of a nature that , in Maritain's words , is perceived as a `` locus of intelligible necessities '' .
An existentialist is a man who perceives himself only as `` esse '' , as existence without substance .
Change involves the displacement of form .
This means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being .
And it would seem that history is a witness to this truth .
Others call it `` alienation '' , and mean by that no simple economic experience ( as Marx does ) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation .
Since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class , reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class .
even the questionable features of the past are defended .
The reactionary is confused about the existential status of a decaying tradition , but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy .
We can also argue that the three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man , Dostoevsky , a conflict having to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman .
I am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects .
The child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother .
Why does the story affect us ? ?
I am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by Lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood .
But a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth , the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness .
the oracle speaks false and the dream speaks true .
His sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own country at a time when Sibylla's domain is overrun by the armies of one of her rejected suitors .
In recollection he has said : `` Natural or man-made objects kept coming into my head , but I would suppress them sternly '' .
His canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be `` Figures In Space '' , or `` Blue Figure '' , or `` Pink Figure '' ; ;
but , he held , instead of continuing as an `` art of reduction '' , it must grow , must make a place for the contributions of the Raphaels and Poussins as well as for those of the early cubists and Mondrian .
But his own work was evolving further .
Very much the political man , Helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of France and all Europe , whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky .
After a year in a studio on Sheridan Square , having married an American girl who was a native of Virginia , Helion moved to a village in the Blue Ridge mountains , where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases .
In haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings : a three-panel frieze , with a flying figure and a fallen figure ; ;
After a sort of death march during four days without food , Helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in East Germany .
At the time of his capture Helion had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at Woolworth's in New York .
Every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories .
Moineau and David held nothing but their fingers .
In prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life , his guards , his companions in misery .
They reincarnated the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since the 1920's .
others were of men doffing their hats to each other , carrying umbrellas with pomp , reading newspapers , or simply showing loaves of bread spread out .
They have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough , I believe , in pointing out Faulkner's independence , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition .
It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought to bear on the history , the traditions , and the lore of his region a critical , skeptical mind -- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique .
The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature .
Faulkner's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with plantation life .
William Gilmore Simms , sturdy realist that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great Elizabethans , to vivify the pale writings being produced around him .
Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods , but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully .
nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters .
As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings , he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble , Arkansas , where no one had ever seen a piano ; ;
Some years ago Julian Huxley proposed to an audience made up of members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science that `` man's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are ( now ) in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice age '' .
He is a Craig's wife who agonizes about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the local university have come to call .
For what do the utopians labor ? ?
There is another kind of ardor , a quiet , sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life , but no angry utopian contentions .
There is essential pleasantness in reading the writing of men who are not angry , who can contend without quarreling .
He begins : ``
As things turned out , however , we have not profited greatly from the lesson : instead of persistently following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever Soviet policy seemed to be at the moment .
The maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood .
The Introduction continues : ``
Of one thing we can be sure : they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the `` free society '' .
This life has its own currents and rhythms , its own multiple cycles and adaptations .
Should Rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory for the advent of television , atomic energy , and IBM machines ? ?
Given the conceptual context within which ancient thought thrived , how could anyone have questioned this principle ? ?
Ships disappear hull-first over the horizon ; ;
A candle alight in the air directs its flame and smoke upwards .
When combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material substratum , it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a scale of material-formal ratios , celestial bodies will be of a subtle , quickened , ethereal existence , in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary .
The distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master , beyond crude conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth .
This is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy .
Some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former .
it involves a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen '' .
This is more ambitious than Ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems .
This was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within Ptolemy's astronomy .
There are in The Almagest no rules for determining in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with abberations in lunar , solar , or planetary behavior .
The lower-level hypotheses are never ' ad hoc ' , never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum .
It is really the funeral day of scholastic science .
Granted , the cosmological , philosophical , and cultural reverberations initiated by the De Revolutionibus were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow .
Geocentricism per se ? ?
Without abandoning too much , Copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable .
usually , this is most exasperating to men , who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly .
Besides , Miss Henrietta -- as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a chignon in the back -- had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing ; ;
and in her forthright way , Henrietta , who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness `` to think of men as the privileged '' and `` women as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception -- he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair , as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College -- until once , in sheer desperation , he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything .
But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters , or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable , lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard Street .
Each was her mother's assistant and confidante ; ;
Adele , like Amy , the youngest of the Marches , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one .
Reporters began to trail Miriam everywhere , and to encourage her to make appalling statements about Wright and his doings .
At last her lawyer , Arthur D. Cloud , gave up the case because she turned down three successive settlements he arranged .
A troop of reporters brought up the rear .
Miriam was stopped at the Taliesin gate , and William Weston , now the estate foreman , came out to parley .
At this point Mrs. Frances Cupply , one of Wright's handsome daughters by his first wife , came from the house and tried to calm Miriam as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass pane on another sign with a rock .
Then , with staring eyes and lips drawn thin , Miriam said to the young woman , `` You are ugly -- uglier than you used to be , and you were always very ugly .
Then , after overtures to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce , Miriam gave a ghastly echo of Mrs. Micawber by suddenly stating , `` I will never leave Mr. Wright '' .
`` You are being strangled by traffic '' .
`` Take a gigantic knife and sweep it over the Loop '' , Wright said .
`` Cut off every building at the seventh floor .
What irritated Miriam was that Wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made , which he considered she would accept `` when she tires of publicity '' .
but Wright stayed in the United States .
It was symbolized ( at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image ) by that self-consuming , elegiac candle of Edna St. Vincent Millay's , that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a beacon to us , but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral taper to last even the evening , let alone the night .
But I will not skip it or cut it out .
Helpless in that sense I can never be again .
For innocence , of all the graces of the spirit , is I believe the one most to be prayed for .
Although it is constantly made to look foolish ( too simple to come in out of the rain , people say , who have found in the innocent an impediment ) , it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks .
I had long since begun to lose my general innocence when I lost my trust in you , but this special innocence I lost before ever I loved , through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing , nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking , let alone with love .
The songs Sandburg sang often reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely or in fragments .
In due time Sandburg was a walking thesaurus of American folk music .
After he had finished the first two volumes of his Lincoln , Sandburg went to work assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the memory of songs others had taught him .
The book , published in 1927 , has been selling steadily ever since .
It is a mistake , however , to imagine that Sandburg uses the guitar as a prop .
To play the guitar as he aspires will devour his three-fold energy as a historian , a poet and a singer .
Mr. Rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one .
' Kalamazoo guitars ' , he said , ' used by radio hillbilly singers .
The impression you get from Carl Sandburg's home is one of laughter and happiness ; ;
She has small , broad , capable hands and an enormous energy .
She was pious , too , once kneeling through the night from Holy Thursday to Good Friday , despite the protest of the nuns that this was too much for a young girl .
She knelt out of reverence for having read the Meditations of St. Augustine .
She passed the entrance examinations to the University of Illinois , but during the year at Urbana felt more important events transpired at the University of Chicago .
Carl , who was stationed in Appleton , Wisconsin , organizing for the Social Democrats , was in Berger's office and made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar .
Not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries ; ;
No longer is the United States the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries .
But the enmities it will incur , the isolation into which it will descend , and the internal moral and spiritual softness that will be engendered , will , in the long term , bring it to economic and political disaster .
America did not become great through softness and self-indulgence .
I cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that , in our own and free world interest , we must co-operate with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions , as expressed in their different multi-year plans .
Free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom .
We face , indeed , what may be a turning point in history , and we must act decisively and wisely .
America possesses an enormous defense power .
It is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support .
Incidentally , there was an Atlas firing last night .
This year , moreover , growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will enter our active forces , some to be armed with Polaris missiles .
the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged labor-management stalemate ; ;
Here , he openly attacked Bang-Jensen and referred to his `` aberrant conduct '' .
He knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence .
Gross's , being `` outside '' the U.N. applied only to a physical state , not an objective one .
`` Mr. Gross , your report says that ' our function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate from or prejudice Mr. Bang-Jensen's rights as a staff member .
`` This is a distressing thing .
For an instant he glared speechless at Marshall .
`` I thought the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end .
`` Well , as a matter of fact , I've looked through back-issue files of New York papers for December , 1957 , and haven't found a great deal '' --
`` Then what about the second interim public announcement ? ?
We attempted to conclude this , and did so by having the papers burned .
Could you comment on that '' ? ?
`` Those '' ! !
When I speak of how Shann felt , I know well .
Chapter 22
from the home of his friend , Henrik Kauffmann , in Washington , D.C. , Paul Bang-Jensen sent a telegram dated December 9 , 1957 , to Ernest Gross .
`` the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character , and I therefore respectfully request that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that I might make adequate preparation '' .
At last they concluded that the heavy , full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise .
Even the first wave of homesickness had passed , although there were moments when Captain Heard pointed out on his compass the direction of Bradford that she felt a little twinge at her heart .
Sometimes a ship would be sighted and the Caravan pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck .
Captain Heard did not communicate with any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the United States and Britain .
I can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming , oh , what a luxury .
even Christ was baptized by this method .
Even Harriet could boldly write , `` I know not how it is ; ;
and yet remain unmoved '' .
Sometimes ships waited for days for such a man , but Captain Heard was lucky .
Ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance .
They are situated in the midst of trees , which hang over them , and appear truly romantick .
The pagodas we have passed are much larger than the houses '' .
Ann , pleased to see her friend happy , was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of Captain Heard had sent on board for their enjoyment .
Although after much trouble he did manage to get it back , he discovered there was no trade to be had .
`` Go back to America or any other place '' , well-meaning friends of Captain Heard advised them , `` but put thoughts of going to Burma out of your heads '' .
When he discovered they had received from the Company's Court of Directors no permission to live in India , coupled with the fact that they were Americans who had been sent to Asia to convert `` the heathen '' , he became more belligerent than ever .
Certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate .
Oxford , realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ , took the opposite view , for which the Queen never forgave him .
Steele's purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which had occupied him in the Englishman ; ;
He claims , too , that his political convictions are simply those which are called `` Revolution Principles '' and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties .
It purports to be a letter from Steele to a friend at court , who , in Miss Blanchard's opinion , could only be meant as Swift .
This is the principal point made in this final section of Englishman No. 57 , and it caps Steele's efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the notion of the Tories as a `` Church Party '' supported by the body of the clergy .
By now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from Tory papers and pamphlets , and action was being taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from Parliament .
If his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been , Mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect .
The countrywide success of `` Lazybones '' and `` And The Angels Sing '' could only lead to Hollywood , where , besides Harold Arlen , Mercer collaborated with Harry Warren , Jimmy Van Heusen , Richard Whiting , Walter Donaldson , Jerome Kern , and Arthur Schwartz .
His casual , dreamlike working methods , often as not in absentia , were an abrupt change from Harburg's , so that Arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration .
There were times that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously .
I wouldn't hear from him for a couple of weeks , then he'd come around with the completed lyric '' .
The American-Negro Suite is in a sense an extension of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection of Negro songs , not for a night club , but for the concert stage .
In the jakes , after Robbie and his crutches were properly stowed , Mr. Herford went to the adjoining facility .
Even earlier than that he had resented the fact that I had been chosen to edit the club's Reporter .
Among the outstanding members of the Hearst cabinet whom he successfully opposed for a time were the great Arthur Brisbane , Bradford Merrill , S.S. Carvalho , and Colonel Van Hamm .
Some of the Hetman's `` ideas '' were dream-ridden , vaguely imparted , and at times preposterous .
He said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip .
I explained my state of mind to artist Winsor McCay and to `` Bugs '' Baer .
`` Where to , sir '' ? ?
Just then a reporter telephoned in from the Bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder .
He campaigned successfully for the riddance of `` Death Avenue '' and also brought about the ending of pollution of metropolitan beaches by sewage .
A little boy came to give the President his personal condolences , and the President gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in .
Mama always felt that the collection symbolized Mrs. Coolidge's wish for a little girl .
The dress in the painting is a bright red , with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side .
But she was afraid the First Lady would not understand , because Rob Roy was a perfect angel with the First Family .
Every day , when the President took his nap , Rob Roy would stretch out on the window seat near him , like a perfect gentleman , and stare thoughtfully out the window , or he would take a little nap himself .
All the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the President and go to the dining room .
A new bill had been passed under Harding that designated the Government , rather than the President , as the tab-lifter for official meals .
So the President would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting Government officials to attend .
He knew exactly how to be colorful ! !
When Mrs. Coolidge was in mourning , she did not wear black .
On the social side , the chore Mama had at the formal receptions at the White House thrilled her the most .
Mama stooped down to fix the train , but there was no train there ! !
they have been someone's enemy .
predispositions regarding intelligence .
He may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs .
But millions of human beings were exposed to Lueger's propaganda and record .
Undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of Gentile conceptions of the Jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality .
Since we can neither undo nor redo the past , we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow .
What are the historical trends in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized ? ?
It is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range .
If Jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal , it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship .
but it is perennially restructured in situations where anchors are dragged or lost .
We are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society ; ;
and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good .
In any case I do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions .
For what we propose , however , a psychoanalyst is not necessary , even though one aim is to enable the reader to get beneath his own defenses -- his defenses of himself to himself .
The relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said , whether he responds with anger or applause .
But simple involvement is not enough ; ;
Scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too .
Probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience , which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature , but the contents of conscience , the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available .
Let us differentiate a few of these ideas .
Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what I mean .
I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth .
but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries , and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place .
It is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy .
also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man , the depravity of man , and the dignity of man .
Again , he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways .
Usually the work studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in question , so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an `` -ism '' or mode of thought .
After all , Shelley is no `` orthodox '' or Hellenic Platonist , and even his `` romantic '' Platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries .
Again , Henley's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like Marcus Aurelius , whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian , comparable to the patience expressed in Milton's sonnet on his own blindness .
Let us quote once more from R. G. Collingwood : `` History is properly concerned with the actions of human beings Regarded from the outside , an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world ; ;
Finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread .
We may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists .
Lane was still burning because he had narrowly missed election as governor of California in 1902 and laid his defeat to the antagonism of Hearst's San Francisco Examiner .
For a freshman Congressman to read political Lessons to graybeard Democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends .
There was a host of dark horses .
The average Democratic politician , especially in the country districts , is hungry for the spoils of office .
In his own state of New York , the two Democratic bellwethers , State Leader Hill and Tammany Boss Murphy , were saying nothing openly against Hearst but industriously boosting their own favorites , Murphy being for Cleveland and Hill for Parker .
The Hearst dollar mark is all over them .
The Hearst `` barrel ''
Later research has shown this part of the legend of the Re Galantuomo to be false .
Trevelyan accepts Italian nationalism with little analysis , he is unduly critical of papal and French policy , and he is more than generous in assessing British policy .
But his concentration on personalities and his categorical assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation .
The strength of the History is also its weakness .
His delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life .
The account of the battle is , next to his descriptions of Garibaldi's campaigns , Trevelyan's outstanding military narrative .
Ramillies And The Union With Scotland has fewer high spots than Blenheim and much less of its dramatic unity .
After making a short statement about human rights , and the freedom to travel , I told them I would be going to the Kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the Rhine into Germany .
The real Franco-German frontier was beyond the town's limits .
Alarmed by this display of weapons , I looked toward the bridge and there saw , stretched across the near side , a cordon of policemen , their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several French officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby .
Your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what I am saying .
`` Visa ? ?
Asked a young mustached Frenchman .
`` I have a small sports shop in Strasbourg '' .
That would be a great help , I told him , thanking him for his thoughtfulness .
The special guard , however , was still posted on Kehl bridge .
On the evening of December 27th , Esther noticed my pallid look and rasping voice .
He advised immediate hospitalization .
`` Jean Babel '' .
He remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final , desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy .
His hat was gone , the tears were streaming from his eyes .
On the morning of September 2 the Fourth Corps and the Armies of the Tennessee and the Ohio followed the line of Hardee's retreat .
The Fourth Corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line .
The cautious Thomas re-examined the note and then , making up his mind that it was genuine , snapped his fingers , whistled and almost danced in his exuberance .
The measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice .
Proposals were in the air for a year's armistice .
Official congratulations showered upon Sherman and his army .
In the summary of the principal events of the campaign compiled from the official records there are only ten days which show no fighting .
The use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers began to select tactical points by designating a spot as `` near the letter o in the word mountain '' .
Then , in some way , this lack of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice .
Second , it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy .
Luckily both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not I '' .
Ever yours sincerely ,
All chance of fulfilling my destiny is over .
If , as Reid says , `` nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not taking opium '' , there may be some reason to doubt that he was under its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the poems to Katie King and making plans for another book of verse .
He simply found more work for him to do , and the articles and reviews continued without an evident break .
As he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year and a half before , Lewis trekked southeast through Red Russia to Kamieniec .
To consolidate what her Navy had won , the Czarina was fortunate that , for the first time in Russian history , her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command under her favorite Giaour .
England contributed a young subaltern named Newton and the naval architect Samuel Bentham , brother to the economist , who for his colonel's commission was proving a godsend to the Russian fleet .
Around the billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals .
Right now he found Sophie De Witt , that magnificent young matron he had spotted at Kamieniec four years ago .
The Prince took her with him on every tour around the area , and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge of Constantinople as part of his espionage network .
Alexander Vasilievitch Suvorov , now in his fifty-ninth year ( ten years Potemkin's senior ) , was a thin , worn-faced person of less than medium height who looked like a professor of botany .
But he was perpetually engaged in a battle to command his own temper .
better to give an asinine answer than none at all .
his supper was nothing .
He had accordingly cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature .
He dabbled in verse , could get along well among most of the European languages , and was fluent in French and German .
Suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic units but military men of a high potential .
He often donned their tribal costumes , such as the one featuring a tall , black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels ; ;
broad red stripes down the trouser leg ; ;
Suvorov played parent not just to his Cossacks but to all his troops .
When their levies came shambling into camp , they were all elbows , hair , and beard .
The doctor gravely nodded approval .
By this time word had got around that an American doctor was on the premises .
`` You know '' , Norton said to me later , `` I am thinking of setting up the Klinico Brownapopolus .
Having completed our camera work , we started our climb .
And then perhaps one day we get to Athens .
It had better be good .
My other nugget of art and architectural knowledge -- besides remembering that it was Ghiberti who designed the doors of the baptistery in Florence -- is the three styles of Greek columns .
On the way out Mr. Sakellariadis detoured up a special hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the Acropolis lighted by night .
By a combination of music , lighting effects , and narration , famous events that have transpired in these locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to considerable acclaim .
Although open to the general public it is not overcrowded ; ;
Three beneficial hurdles to progress are the lack of water , electricity , and telephones .
Later they would be hoisted into place .
I think its thirst had never been assuaged before .
But this one was .
Shortly after the `` Vale '' incident , a rift began to develop between William Woodruff and Governor Pope .
Besides being political allies , they were also friends .
It was at this point that Pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two men .
The governor was not used to having his integrity questioned , and he promptly passed the charges on to Woodruff , demanding that Woodruff answer them .
Woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma .
For some reason , none of them were impressed with the territorial capital .
Edward Rawson , secretary of the colony of Massachusetts Bay , described him as `` a man whose spirit was stark drunk with blasphemies and insolence , a corrupter of the truth , a disturber of the peace wherever he comes '' .
He was universally beloved by his neighbours , and the Indians , who esteemed him , not only as a friend , but one high in communion with God in Heaven '' .
He defied the Boston hierarchy , and after they sent a small army to get him he befuddled the court , including John Cotton , with one of the most complicated religious discourses ever heard .
Gorton and his family moved to Plymouth .
Gorton then moved to Providence and soon put the town in a turmoil .
Williams also stated : `` Our peace was like the peace of a man who hath the tertian ague '' .
The settlement was called Shawomet .
Then Massachusetts switched to its standard tactics .
The attack started on October 2 , 1643 , and the Gortonists held out for a day and a night .
The prisoners agreed , provided they might speak after the sermon , which was permitted .
The Boston elders were great at befuddling the opposition with torrents of ecclesiastical obscurities , but Gorton was better .
They made the tests and came to Fred ; ;
`` But we aren't going to let you give him any '' .
And in a few minutes Papa was dead .
It was well past midnight .
A biographical sketch followed .
So what Fred and Ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking into account what each of the five had received , if anything , from the estate before Papa's death .
Papa , I should emphasize , had been an invalid the last several years of his life ; ;
Had he been able to escape this long siege of invalidism , I'm convinced , Papa would have left a sizable estate .
I have known Papa to exclaim on getting his tax bill , `` we're going to the dogs '' ! !
But he never expected to do that .
But Papa's death had further complicated the financing of Tom's hoped-for third year , and for the weeks following it Tom did not know whether his return to Harvard could be arranged .
I think I'm right in that figure .
he despised parsimony , and particularly of words .
And he threatened someday to write a play `` with fifty , eighty , a hundred people -- a whole town , a whole race , a whole epoch '' .
Tom told me about it , how one evening he went over to see the Theatre Guild man .
The public , Tom said the man told him , wanted realism , and his play wasn't that .
It was not until we had returned to the city to live , while I was still at Brown and Sharpe's , that I felt the full impact of evangelical Christianity .
I went to an afternoon service at the Aj .
As we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable .
Their basis seems deeper than mere authority .
One's daily work becomes sacred , since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law , dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy .
One serves society by conducting a business from which a certain number of employees draw their means of subsistence ; ;
This intellectual approach to spiritual life suited me well , because I was never content to lead a divided life .
This complacency was blown to bits by the relativity of Einstein , the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the discovery of the expanding universe .
It is as if we , in our center of human observation , from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown .
Such a list must naturally be selective , and the treatment of each man is brief , for I am interested only in their general ideas on the moral measure of literature .
Even more important , in his Poetics , Aristotle differs somewhat from Plato when he moves in the direction of treating literature as a unique thing , separate and apart from its causes and its effects .
True reality , of course , is the ideal , and the poet knows nothing of this ; ;
By the time they reach that age , however , Aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence of comedies .
He rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to that end .
It may allay our passions and so restore the rule of reason .
Many students of literature know that classical defense .
For this reason , then I want to describe , first , two examples of the puritanical attacks : Stephen Gosson's The School Of Abuse , 1579 , and his later Playes Confuted , published in 1582 .
We find , in the first place , that the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education , positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing , do not accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the public prints , and , on the whole , approve of the way their university deals with value-problems and value inculcation .
It is not our impression that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful ignorance ; ;
In the university milieu of scholarship and research , of social diversity , of new ideas and varied and wide-ranging interests , `` socialization '' into a campus culture apparently means heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education in the arts and sciences .
The purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute .
But the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen .
In other words , as students go through college , those who are most successful academically tend to become more committed to a `` Bill of Rights '' orientation .
In this sense also , they are surely conformists .
These personal and social goals often overshadow the goals of intellectual clarity , and spiritual transcendence .
after all , feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions of youth .
Kluckhohn recently has summarized evidence regarding changes in values during a period of years , primarily 1935-1955 , but extending much farther back in some instances .
Morgan was ordered to attack the enemy , who had meantime moved to Edge Hill on the left of the Americans .
In late December , the American army moved from Whitemarsh to Valley Forge , and although the distance was only 13 miles , the journey took more than a week because of the bad weather , the barefooted and almost naked men .
`` They straggle at such a rate '' , he told the commander-in-chief , `` that if the enemy were enterprising , they might get two from us , when we would take one of them , which makes me wish General Howe would go on , lest any incident happen to us '' .
But Morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a William Pickman in Salem , Massachusetts , apparently an acquaintance , praising Washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were `` opposed by the general current of the people to exalt General Gates at the expense of General Washington was injurious to the latter .
On May 6th , Morgan , who had returned , received from Washington orders to `` send out patrols under vigilant officers '' to keep near the enemy .
These were Oneida Indians .
Nogaret is hardly an impartial witness , and even he did not make his charges against Boniface until the latter was dead , but there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say .
Loyal and unscrupulous , with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies , he outmatched the English diplomats time and time again until , by a kind of poetic justice , he fell at the battle of Courtrai , the victim of the equally nationalistic if less articulate Flemings .
The English , relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior diplomatic skill , were also hampered in their negotiations by the events that were taking place at home .
The Scots had found a new leader in William Wallace , and Edward's yearly expeditions across the Border called for evermounting taxes , which only increased his difficulties with the barons and the clergy .
He was unable to send any more help to his allies on the Continent , and during the next few years many of them , left to resist French pressure unaided , surrendered to the inevitable and made their peace with Philip .
Time went on and everybody got older .
They were like two strangers .
Meltzer stayed with Alfred , and when the door opened they both came out .
The car began to move and Harry ran after it crying , `` Alfred ! !
Meltzer was a boarder with the Banks family .
Banks the Butcher was a hard master and a hard father , a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade .
Later , when I was older , I found the song was part of Schubert's Die Schone Mullerin .
Place-names , in fact , had been extensively utilized for this purpose from the time of Camden onwards .
Almost inevitably , the first result of this technological revolution was a reaction against the methods and in many cases the conclusions of the Oxford school of Stubbs , Freeman and ( particularly ) Green regarding the nature of the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britain .
By 1913 , Ferdinand Lot could begin an article subtitled `` La Conquete De La Grande-Bretagne par Les Saxons '' with the words , `` Il est difficile aujourd'hui d'entretenir des illusions sur la valeur du recit traditionnel de la conquete de la Grande-Bretagne .
In fact , modern scholarly opinion in the main has not retreated all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the nineteenth century .
Most now admit that Bede , Gildas , Nennius and The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles cannot be the infallible guides to early English history that Guest , Freeman and Green thought them to be .
H.L. Gray in his English Field Systems and Zachrisson's Romans , Kelts And Saxons defended in part the Seebohm thesis while at the present time H.P.R. Finberg and Gordon Copley seem to fall into the Celtic survivalist camp .
On the other side are the Celtic survivalists who have taken a tack divergent from both these schools of nineteenth century thought .
Moreover , they have done so in rather special circumstances .
in other words its existence belongs to the period of Roman Britain .
So whenever the Romans finally withdrew from the island , the Saxon Shore disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century .
We also know that the Saxon Shore as reflected in the Notitia was created as a part of the Theodosian reorganization of Britain ( post A.D. 369 ) .
My argument is that there was no Saxon Shore prior to that time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of Carausius .
Wood took the proposal to Chief of Staff Hugh L. Scott , who passed it on to Baker a month before the actual declaration of war against Germany .
Baker took the plan to Wilson who said : `` Baker , this is plainly right on any ground .
The result was that by secret agreement draft machinery was actually ready long before the country knew that the device was to take the place of the volunteering method which Theodore Roosevelt favored .
it was Baker who thought of lessening the shock , which conscription always brings to a country , by substituting `` Greetings from your neighbors '' for the recruiting sergeant , and registration in familiar voting places rather than at military installations .
Democratic Speaker Champ Clark saw little difference between a conscript and a convict .
In early June ten million young men registered by name and number .
it was another to house , feed , and train them .
six days after war was declared he appointed Raymond Fosdick chairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities ( the CTCA ) .
His assignment was not a new one because Baker had sent him to the Mexican border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack of discipline , drunkenness , and venereal disease in American military camps .
The problem involved military necessity as much as morality , for in pre-penicillin days venereal disease was a crippling disability .
Baker put the `` cribs '' and the saloons out of bounds , ordered the co-operation of military officers with local law authorities , and told communities that the troops would be moved unless wholesome conditions were restored .
From the point of view of popularity the best-known member of the Commission was Walter Camp , the Yale athlete whose sobriquet was `` the father of American football '' .
In the imagination of the nineteenth century the Greek tragedians and Shakespeare stand side by side , their affinity transcending all the immense contrarieties of historical circumstance , religious belief , and poetic form .
Modern roosters have lost the art of crowing restless spirits back to Purgatory .
Agamemnon , Creon , and Medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes of the polis .
Heretofore an action had possessed the breadth of tragedy only if it involved high personages and if it occurred in the public view .
They order the manifold levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which extends from brute matter to the immaculate stars .
The poet was by definition a realist , his imaginings and parables being natural organizations of reality .
And although they were , as I have indicated , under increasing strain at the time of Racine , they are still alive in his theatre .
And their chroniclers are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists .
The conventions into which the romantics tried to breath life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought and feeling .
It is thus that the brightness of Helen passes through Marlowe's Faustus .
This translation , or rather the fusion of the two ideals , creates the Gesamtkunstwerke , the `` total art form '' .
He refused his consent to the election of Quiney as bailiff in 1592 , but gave it at the request of the recorder , his cousin Sir Fulke Greville .
In his letter mentioning Shakespeare on January 24 , 1597/8 , Sturley asked Quiney especially that `` theare might ( be ) bi Sir Ed. Grev. some meanes made to the Knightes of the Parliament for an ease and discharge of such taxes and subsedies wherewith our towne is like to be charged , and I assure u I am in great feare and doubte bi no meanes hable to paie .
Sir Ed. Gre. is gonne to Brestowe and from thence to Lond. as I heare , who verie well knoweth our estates and wil be willinge to do us ani good '' .
This seems to refer , not to the loan Richard had asked for , but to a proposed bargain with Shakespeare .
Further letters in November mention that Sir Edward paid forty pounds .
my mare at coming up 14 days ; ;
He set down that `` I gave Mr. Greene a pynte of muskadell and a roll of bread that last morning I went to have his company to Master Attorney '' .
The fall of Rome , the discovery of precious metals , and the Protestant Reformation were all links and could only be explained and understood by comprehending the links that preceded and those that followed .
They react in obedience to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural law .
Adams firmly contended that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical environment on history .
However , as a practicing historian , he , himself , has left few clues to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing history .
He deplored the impact of German historiography on the writing of history , terming it a `` dismal monster '' .
If the historian was convinced of his own correctness , then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by disturbing facts .
It was history that must be in error , not the historian .
No page seems to be complete without the statement of at least one unproved generalization .
J. T. Shotwell was appalled by such spurious history as that which attributed the fall of the Carolingian empire to the woolen trade , and he urged Adams to `` transform his essay into a real history , embodying not merely those facts which fit into his theory , but also the modifications and exceptions '' .
Furthermore , he must regard religion as the expression of human forces .
He had not yet undertaken the great exploit of his later years , the rediscovery of the ancient Inca highway , the route of Pizarro in Peru , but he had climbed to the original El Dorado , the Andean lake of Guatemala , and he had scaled the southern Sierra Nevada with its Tibetan-like people and looked into the emerald mines of Muzo .
He had written to me about a dinner he had had with the Benedictine monks at St. Anselm's Priory in Washington .
He felt as I felt about this best of all my books , that it was `` really tops '' .
I could never forget the gaiety with which , when he was both blind and deaf , he let me lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures ; ;
Later , rising ninety , he was beset by publishers for the story of his life and miracles , as he put it , but , calling himself the Needy Knife-grinder , he had spent his time writing short articles and long letters and could not get even a small popular book done .
With their facile generalizations about the United States , these mediocrities , as they often were , had been great successes .
And she withdrew then to Cromwell Hall , in Cromwell , Connecticut .
He was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go abroad when the Gantry galleys were finished .
After a dinner party for which she had come down to New York , Mrs. Lewis and Casanova arrived to see them off , and Elinor Wylie made tart observations that indicated that Lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to be about the real nature of their separation .
In London Lewis took the usual suite in Bury Street .
To the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life , about his wish to be a newspaperman once more , about the prevalence of American slang in British speech , about the loquacity of the English and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage , about his plans to wander for two years `` unless stopped and made to write another book '' .
It was a dinner party , Lewis had been drinking during the afternoon , and long before the party really got under way , he was quite drunk , with the result that the party broke up even before dinner was over .
Finally , at dawn , he fell asleep , and when he awoke and came into the living room , he found Lewis in his pajamas before the fire , smoking a cigarette .
Blackman said that he wanted to apologize for not having prevented Lewis from making that horrible spectacle of himself , that he should have seized him by the neck at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom .
Lewis looked at him and began to cry , and then , saying that he was going to make a promise , he asked Blackman to call the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did not want .
He suggested that they call on these brothers , who received them pleasantly .
He said , `` We had a good time tonight , didn't we , Earl '' ? ?
Earl agreed , and Lewis said that it would have been very different if his wife had been with him .
He smoked , as did everybody , and imbibed the various alcoholic beverages of that day , although his protestations while at Cambridge and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and , we must add , of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers .
It is not a question of truth or falsity ; ;
But the real beginnings of this development in him go back to the opposing of grammar school , and probably if it had not been this occasion and these Latin lines it would have been some others , such as the first prolusion , that set off this streak in him of unbridled and scathing verbal attack on an enemy .
No other names among the young men in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by Milton as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted .
Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 ( 1954 ) presents a book-burning society in which wall television and hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds ; ;
Since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the last twelve years , it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief impetus was the 1949 publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four , an assumption which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as Room 101 , along with education by conditioning from Brave New World , a book to which science-fiction writers may well have returned with new interest after reading the more powerful Orwell dystopia .
Like ours , the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order to survive , and , like ours , it is based on the principle of `` ever increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption '' .
As Courtenay explains , `` Here in this profession we reach into the souls of men and women .
Indeed , again and again , the space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners and behavioral scientists , once they have seen through human nature , will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide them .
`` Young for his age '' means only the presence of some minor characteristic not quite usual .
An assumption of youth , or the presence of a few youthful characteristics , deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed hair .
age may be idealistic , believing and much given to professions of optimism .
But there is , nevertheless , always a subtle difference in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held .
We cannot truthfully say of anyone who has succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old .
Those famous lines of the Greek Anthology with which a fading beauty dedicates her mirror at the shrine of a goddess reveal a wise attitude : `` Venus , take my votive glass , Since I am not what I was , What from this day I shall be , Venus , let me never see '' .
At least I should like them to know that I know these discounts are being made .
The favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval of communism is that they did not know how things would develop .
It concerns a small-town minister who staged an impressive object lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside his church door .
One day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators who wanted to know his secret .

All you have to do is put in a fresh lamb from time to time '' .
In fact I cannot imagine myself condemning a man to the noose or the electric chair if I had to take , as an individual , the responsibility for his death .
Should no murderer ever be executed '' ? ?
The whole purpose of Man's Hope is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and ends inherent in all organized political violence -- and even when such violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty , justice and human dignity .

The Walnut Trees Of Altenburg is composed in the form of a triptych , with the two small side panels framing and enclosing the main central episode of the novel .
The narrator feels himself catching a glimpse of pre-history , learning of man's `` age-old familiarity with misfortune '' , as well as his `` equally age-old ingenuity , his secret faith in endurance , however crammed with catastrophes , the same faith perhaps as the cave-men used to have in the face of famine '' .

The burden of these reflections is that a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs .
A realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization on the one hand , and our capacity to achieve them on the other , must be approached through the concept of `` community '' .
History has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external danger ceases to be dramatically urgent .
Only when a concert of nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy .
A working concept of the organic evolution of community must lead us in a different direction .
A `` concert of free nations '' should take its inspiration from the traditions of the nineteenth century Concert of Europe with its common values and accepted `` rules of the game '' .
Constitutions of and by themselves mean little ; ;
Even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry .
) The stated goal of the CJS is the synthesis of jazz and `` serious '' music .
From the beginning of his career , Patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry .
Patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and money-hungry people .
In Patchen's eyes , organized churches are as odious as organized governments , and Christian symbols , having been taken over by the moneyed classes , are now agents of corruption .
Many of his poems purported to be exactly contemporary and political ; ;
The private detective is militant against injustice , a humorous and ironic explorer of the underworld ; ;
He has , like so many other secular and religious culture symbols , gone over to the side of the ruling classes .
The immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger generation must have impressed him , and he began working toward the merger of jazz and poetry , as he had previously attempted the union of graphic art and poetry .
he usually draws some kind of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading -- for instance , he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an Oriental courtesan waiting for the man she loves , and who never comes , and the old blues chants of Ma Rainy and other Negro singers -- but usually the comparison is specious .
These new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians , but they show changes in Patchen's approach to his poetry , for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude of the jazz musician .
His approach to music is highly individualistic ; ;
While he is worldly , the musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment and naivete .
he is far from being a literary hero , yet is a creative artist .
Angry that none of us knew anything but filth and poverty .
Can't hold her little white han' ! !
each is so typical that it represents a prominent trend in the poet's development .
Perhaps Patchen was once involved in a train accident , and this passage from First Will And Testament may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he first saw it -- if he did : ``
But I've got news for Krim : he's not typical , he's pretty special .

An Italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around the area of Quirinal Palace , the first time since the war .
We saw Giuseppe Berto at a party once in a while , tall , lean , nervous and handsome , and , in our opinion , the best novelist of them all except Pavese , and Pavese is dead .

And , if we follow the Rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country .
And the name Rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of American politics for the last half century .
It is , I insist , hard to define the Rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated , and because it goes so deep .
Although Sam Rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances , nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition .

With few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $15 per day subsistence .
Origin of state automobile practices
Few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940 .
It does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy .
It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation .
Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made .
Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis .
Moreover , it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet ; ;
From this , motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data .
In 1959-60 , vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile .
Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public .
Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles .
The legislature's role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles .
The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration .
The Rhode Island property tax
Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles .
Obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December .
A recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport Airpark in Middletown , to the North Central Airport in Smithfield .
Assessment of value .
This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors , who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem .
To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island .
It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property , and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes .
On this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now .
Interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats .
It has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats .
It is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation .
The assessors' association , meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem .
What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs .

The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 .
The collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose .
It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island .
It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts .
When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; ;
and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases .
This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year .
Disadvantages .
These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle .
Little can be done about the changing of dates .
It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city .
Second , the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns .
An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought .
Varying adjustments .
The President of the United States , pursuant to a Joint Resolution of Congress , has issued a proclamation each year since 1933 declaring May 22nd to be National Maritime Day .
The day is now appropriately set aside to honor the American men and women who have contributed to the success of our merchant marine fleet in peace and war .
and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Tuesday , October 24th , 1961 , as United Nations day , calling upon all our citizens to engage in appropriate observances , demonstrating faith in the United Nations and thereby contributing to a better understanding of the aims of the United Nations throughout the land .

Mr. Dooley .
Mr. Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have .

Mr. Lindsay .
Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home .
Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States , violate the Monroe Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin American republic .
For years the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro's representative from secret military talks .
But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job .
A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere '' .
Look at Castro now -- cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas .
Among these questions : what would a Cuba blockade take ? ?
The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba .
To round out the blockading force , submarines would be needed -- to locate , identify and track approaching vessels .
Once these conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk .
In a total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs .
Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50-50 basis .
The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program :
Determine the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U. S. ( Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above .
( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 .
( See Source of Data , below for population data to be used in this step .
( Multiply result obtained in item 7 above , by result obtained in item 6 above .
) 12 .
As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula .
Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) 25% a year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and 30% , respectively .

Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's notes and report , especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of Justice's recommendation to the appeal board .
He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella v. United States , 348 U.S. 385 ( 1955 ) .
Petitioner knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file .
Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed .
Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts .
Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report .

Respect for the opinions of mankind
What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership .
The problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors -- political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative -- to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control .

Forces and military personnel strength .
I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare .
These expenditures are estimated to be $12.1 billion , an increase of $187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) .
Traditionally , rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel .
The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 .
Thus , the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system is doubtful .

For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time .
For this concept of an Advisory Board , ancillary to the Board of Trustees , we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University , A. Lawrence Lowell , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration .

When the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world .
With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R. Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology .
The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown , for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ;
Several efforts were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the Brown & Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today .
As one development followed another , the company's reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture .
Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture .
During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter , a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics .
The micrometer caliper , as a common workshop tool , also owes much to J. R. Brown .
Along with J. R. Brown's other major developments , the universal grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting the course of Brown & Sharpe for many years to come .
In 1951 , Henry D. Sharpe , Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working equipment business .
The Machine Tool Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines , grinding machines of many types , and knee and bed-type milling machines .
Recently added is the Brown & Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development .
Net income was $2,557,111 , or $3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $2,323,867 or $2.82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares .
This machine , operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions per minute , is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today .
Take-up machines
A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns .
We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction .
Initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will manufacture in this country .
There is a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military .
Early in August we broke ground for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations .
However , its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs .
Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank .

Introduction
Mars has been observed twice at about 3-cm wave length , and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars .
The apparent black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation .
The use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation , and only if the planet really radiates as a black body , will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material .
Observations have also been made at 1.5 mm using optical techniques ( Sinton , 1955 , 1956 , ; ;
see also chap. 11 ) .
Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it .
The antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured ( Mayer , McCullough , and Sloanaker , 1958 ) , so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known .
The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about 18'.5 , and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon .
Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) .
This energy transfer depends on the current , the temperature in the arc column , the anode material , and the conditions in the anode sheath .
2 .
The graphite was National Carbon NC 60 , which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 .
At 100 Amp the 360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 V ( peak to peak ) with a resistive load .
It was denoted by Af .
The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of Af .
It was calculated from the temperature gradient Af at Af inch as Af .
There is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed .
A tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks .
After it has reached terminal velocity , the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded .
There is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear , so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar .
The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference Af and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear .
The direction of the tension of minimum pressure is , of course , given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids .
( Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction of shear , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup .
The internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume .
In other words , if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature , the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink .
The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its surroundings .
A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline Af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented .
the magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei .
A very fine , gray solid ( about 15 g ) is formed , water-washed by centrifugation , and dried at 110-degrees-C ) .
Electron microscopic examination of the Af sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3M in diameter .
We found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination .
The value of Af estimated at 470 gauss was Af microseconds .
The value derived was 16 microseconds .
Spectra were obtained over the temperature range of 77 - 294-degrees-K .
For the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades .
The temperature was maintained to within about Af for the period of time required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour ) .
In the household market , there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder ; ;
and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules , none of which are now nationally advertised .
These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28 .
Cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces .
Even here there is room for some variation , for metal surfaces vary in smoothness , absorptive capacity , and chemical reactivity .
As is the case with the surface-active agent , the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high .
In addition , the polyphosphates are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else .
Physical chemistry of washing
This is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles , or to stick to an uncharged surface .
( 2 ) In the critical micelle region , there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles , which have a degree of polymerization averaging around 60 - 80 .
Although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process .
Cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil .
It is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe .
The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions .
It was then distilled at least three times from a trap at -78-degrees to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each distillation .
In a few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing of 1 mm. wall thickness .
Changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell .
The liquid phase photochemical reaction .
The impact rate on 1958 Alpha for 153 events was Af for particles of mass greater than Af ( Dubin , 1960 ) ; ;
These extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in Whipple's table .
Also , it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites ( Best , 1960 ) , and the same distribution would not be expected .
Biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon .
Thus , an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities .
The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms .
An aerosol of such small particles , moreover , diffuses through structures in much the same manner as a gas .
This operation was started at 5:00 p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes .
An enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious .
Agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing Q fever , tularemia , brucellosis , glanders , coccidioidomycosis , etc. , belong in this category .
It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains .
Some of those who question the value of BW have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics .
One might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack .
It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons .
The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack .
A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies .
Speer and coworkers , in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera , used a series of gradients for elution from Aj .
In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson , and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described .
One contained complete antibody and had a titer of 1 : 512 in saline .
These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous Af red cells .
Anti-A and anti-B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A , group B or group O donors by the following tube agglutination methods .
The anti-human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits .
Five milliamperes/cell were applied for 18 hr , after which the strips were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using a Spinco Analytrol .
The unstained strips were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands .
In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected ( Region 3 , Fig. 1 ) .
Moreover , after concentration using negative pressure dialysis , agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a ( donors P. J. , D. A. , and J. F. , Fig. 1 ) .
I must add at once that these animals are what we call `` queens '' , young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn .
On this , she builds an `` egg compartment '' or `` egg cell '' which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture called beebread .
Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon and pupates .
The young queens and drones leave the nest and mate , and after a short period of freedom , the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter .
As a result , the proportion of males ( which leave the nest ) increases , and eventually the old colony will die out completely .
The nest itself , the structure that in some cases housed about 2,000 individuals when the season was at its peak , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths .
The females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns , where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds .
yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either .
Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length .
There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda ) .
Data on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does , indeed , attain the greatest length .
data on the boa constrictor about match this .
Oliver , in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States , could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers , which I shall consider separately .
Discussions of the giants one by one will include , as far as possible , data on these aspects of growth : size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached ; ;
rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage ; ;
He concluded that the anaconda's maximum length is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters , which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet ( 14 meters is slightly less than 46 feet ) .
Oliver's 37-1/2 feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable .
When some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated , little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected .
The results are too varied to allow generalization .
Here the pulmonary vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum ( figs. 23 , 24 ) .
In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery .
Also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; ;
probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ;
A reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present .
In addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog .
Ellis , Grindlay and Edwards ( '52 ) also were unable to find them in rats .
This is especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences from man .
There the middle one of the three curves denotes `` mean Skeletal Age '' for the Maturity Series boys and girls .
For example , arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 , whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4 .
Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth , dietary patterns , and health during adolescence .
Accordingly , girls 31 , 29 , 33 , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , 32 , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule '' at Onset and Completion .
Accordingly , if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche , early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification for the 18 girls with `` same schedule '' .
thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys .
B .
In the absence of additions to the homogenate , the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein ( Fawcett and Kirkwood , 1953 ; ;
Serif and Kirkwood , 1958 ; ;
De Groot and Carvalho , 1960 ) .
It has been suggested that the plasma thyroxine-binding proteins , which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine , compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ( Ingbar and Freinkel , 1957 ) .
It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such .
With lower levels , thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine .
The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone .
The first attempts to isolate TSH came a decade later , when Janssen and Loeser ( 1931 ) used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble TSH from insoluble impurities .
Developments up to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg ( 1958 ) .
Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood .
For the most part , this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard .
Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use .
Additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly , peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans , and cholelithiasis .
Electromyography revealed no evidence of lower motor neuron disease .
In spite of normal thyroid function tests , a trial of propylthiouracil , 400 mg. daily for one week , was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness .
Repeated attempts to withdraw steroids entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted , as well as fever , malaise , anorexia , anxiety , and an exacerbation of the anemia .
These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism .
Extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of D8 was found .
The heart weighed 510 gm. , and at the outflow tracts the left and right ventricles measured 19 and 3 mm. , respectively .
The myocardium of the posterior base of the left ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over a 7.5 cm. area .
In particular , the orifices of the right renal and celiac arteries were virtually occluded , and both calcified common iliac arteries were completely occluded .
Some liver cord cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm , while others had small amounts of brown hemosiderin pigment .
The mucosa of the jejunum and ileum showed similar changes , and in some areas the submucosa was edematous and contained considerable numbers of neutrophils .
The kidneys were pale and weighed right , 110 gm. , and left , 230 gm. .
The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty replacement .
The cells of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series were normal except for their numbers .
In association with these changes in the fibers , there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei .
In contrast to the nuclear changes described above , another change in muscle nuclei was seen , usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae .
As controls other sections were similarly covered with Aj .
Direct method .
Results
specificity of staining
In the first few experiments Af was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder .
Distribution of virus antigen
Frequently a few isolated thick-walled cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the xylem region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cells , ray cells , or pith .
Within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of WTV antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm .
In the direct method , Af , not further treated , stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems nonspecifically and WTV tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable Af .
But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat , sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex .
It should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception , memory , imagination , and creativity .
13 .
The shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance .
The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance remain to be elucidated .
In other studies , loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol ) treatments , suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes .
These are few and seemingly disjointed data , but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation , pharmacological action , or clinical processes .
On the physiological basis of some form of psychotherapy
He showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned ( conditioned ) reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible .
He then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses .
Concluding remarks
We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic-cortical discharge .
Although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems , as a first approximation , it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances , in experimental and clinical neurosis , and as the result of psychopharmacological agents .
Let Af be the null space of Af .
Conversely , suppose that **ya is in the null space of Af .
This completes the proof of statement ( A ) .
When Af for each i , we shall have Af , because the operator Af will then be 0 on the range of Af .
Proof .
In concluding this section , we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem .
7-1 .
We begin with a few examples of binomial experiments .
Aces ( ones ) with three dice .
When three dice are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability that the number of aces is 0 ( or 1 , or 2 , or 3 ) ? ?
Before deriving this formula , we explain what we mean by `` problems of this kind '' .
Considering only these Fridays , what is the probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times ? ?
The managers stay the same , so that Af is the same for all weeks .
Experiment without a fixed number of trials .
The word `` binomial '' means `` of two names '' or `` of two terms '' , and both usages apply in our work : the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial , and the second to the terms P and Af that represent the probabilities of `` success '' and `` failure '' .
Note that we need not know the value of p , for the experiment to be binomial .
Experiment where p is not constant .
Indeed , the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family .
An experiment consists of the voting of one couple , or two trials .
Thus in independent voting , Af or 0.52 of the couples would agree .
A binomial experiment consists of Af independent binomial trials , all with the same probability Af of yielding a success .
When each number of successes X is paired with its probability of occurrence Af , the set of pairs Af , is a probability function called a binomial distribution .
The numbers of successes on the five individual shots are , then , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 .
For the vertex at Af , these values will be denoted by Af .
With the vertex at Af in the C-plane we assume that Af is the parametric location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and Af .
Thus if E is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a monotone function .
This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals .
In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af .
For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and Af must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of C , Af could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at T is the argument of the function , not a value .
Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af .
Further , we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of F can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even integer .
We erect a square with PQ as a side and with free corners Af and Af adjacent to P and Q respectively .
We first define a function b{t} as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at t , b{t} is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between T and the backward corner points .
Now with P fixed at Af , Af-values occur when the corner Af crosses C , and are among the values of S such that Af .
Thus we obtain g{t} by introducing an oblique g{t}-axis in the Aj .
In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex numbers .
There are various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images are not unique .
For the lines of any plane , **yp , meeting Q in a conic C , are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve C' into which C is transformed in the point involution on Q .
Each generator , **yl , of Af is also exceptional , for each is transformed into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transformed by the point involution on Q .
The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af .
By ( 1 ) , the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order Af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , C , of order Af .
Now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle with vertex , P , on **zg which is effected by the involution as a whole .
In the first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the vertex , P , to the intersection of **zg and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant .
If **ya is the multiple secant of **zg which passes through Af and **yb is the simple secant of **zg which passes through Af , and if Af are the points in which **ya meets **zg , and if Af is the image of Af on the generator **yb , it follows that the image of the line Af is Af .
For example , in accordance with the fashion of the times , most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years ; ;
American policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies .
Only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance .
To achieve this goal of balanced development , communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account .
It should be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society .
as part of a larger development effort , however , it may gain wide acceptance .
At a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as India , Brazil , the Philippines , and Taiwan , which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth .
We have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries ; ;
2 : :
Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions .
Related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe .
He is not lost in the abyss of endless time ; ;
it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality , sociality , and creativeness .
At the same time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment , it also has great therapeutic value for him .
The religion supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values .
for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism .
The religion , in fact , is an expression of the unity of the group , small or large .
As Yinger has pointed out , the `` reliance on symbols , on tradition , on sacred writings , on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values , turns one to the past far more than to the future '' .
Here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation .
Of startling significance , too , is the assertion that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated child guidance services .
Our literature is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the globally utopian .

The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population .
The element of status-roles and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of conjectures about them .
The large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the upper positions .
The four functional problems of a social system are , to some extent , solved by the subsystems within this population .
Integration `` has to do with the inter-relation of parts '' .
In this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within the same general locality , the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the Brandywine population .
The population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger .

Similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females .
The cards of permanent out-migrants are , in theory , sent to an office in the place of new residence .
Finally , the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions .
Its findings are reported each year in its Rapport Sur l'activite Pendant annee ( Bruxelles ) .
Somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas .
Some 30,000 completed schedules with 20 items ( collected by sub-chiefs in 1,100 circumscriptions ) have been tabulated .
Statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs .
A Bureau De La Demographie ( A. Romaniuk , Director ) was formed under AIMO in the Congo , to work in close rapport with the Section Statistique of the Secretariat General .
The initiation of sampling censuses in Ruanda-Urundi ( 1952 ) and in the Congo ( 1955 - 57 ) were major advances .
These teams carried out the same operations successively in different areas .
Sample units ( villages in rural areas , houses in cities ) were drawn systematically within these strata .
These changes represent , in effect , a shift from ( 1 ) an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to ( 2 ) a systematic sampling census of the whole African population .
It provides a frame for the sampling census .
It is still used in making current population estimates in post-census years , though the value of these estimates is open to question .
Other reports in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issued .
Toward the end of the semester's work , he interviewed every married class member at great length .
In their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time .
A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students .
Many of them appear to drop out , for one reason or another .
In the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged .
Some of these speculations may have some merit , others are somewhat ambiguous .
But the greater part of semester time was actually centered around the attitudes : `` So we are married -- now how do we make the best of it '' ? ?
Films were used , as with all sections , but with one big difference .
The writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be .
These students , although they might read various articles in popular magazines , more often chose to report on articles found in the journals .
This was not a particularly shocking or unexpected thing -- it was previously known to her that it might happen .
But just when was an unknown , and of course the longer it did not happen , the stronger her wish and belief that it might not .
Perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent .
Never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various stages of pregnancy .
Responses such as `` rope with a loop in it '' , and `` two pieces of rope '' , were quite characteristic .
One prediction had been made about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not .
This subject was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first .
They knew that their perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the aniseikonic lenses .
While the interpretations that have been given are inferences only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the tilt illusion .
The final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores .
The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters .
The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity .
Criterion measurement
In the primary grades , reading permeates almost every aspect of school progress , and the children's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively enduring throughout the following years .
Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable .
According to the theory proposed , this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment .
Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting .
Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals .
Examples
Interviewing , checking references , training the salesmen , having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive -- and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high .
One handled the salesman in a friendly manner , another in a rough manner , and the third in a hesitating manner .
All applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist .
Turnover rates of personnel went up , production dropped , and morale was visibly reduced .
He played a number of typical situations before observers , other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong .
One by one , these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors .
When an evaluative situation is set up , and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate , we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation .
the objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts .
One hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks , I felt only a cold annoyance with her .
At first I did not know what she meant ; ;
What had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now , despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like .
Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist , some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition of which , as a part of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome .
I have found , time and again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in the final analysis , on this basis ; ;
One cannot assume , of course , that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy , or at any one time later on when the stereotype was uttered ; ;
Or , equally often , a concretistic-seeming , particularistic-seeming statement may consist , with its mundane exterior , in a form of poetry -- may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression : a metaphor , a smile , an allegory , or some other symbolic mode of speaking .
His subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one .
For English the reduction in size is less striking .
This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word .
For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list ; ;
A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in Af ; ;
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
This initiates the second step of glossary lookup -- connecting the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms .
The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe .
Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj .
The address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form .
the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents .
Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form .
( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings .
Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form .
When irregularity and variation prevent summarizing , information is written in complete detail .
In I know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing ; ;
They are likely to lose dominant stress .
but if George has just been mentioned prominently ( and the trip to be made has been under discussion ) , what is said is probably I'll go with him , and dominant stress is probably on the preposition with .
If both George and a piece of information George does not have are prominent in the context , but the idea of telling George is new , then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell George ? ?
In I have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do .
When the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to I have instructions which I am to leave , dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions .
Other examples follow .
`` I'll come by Tuesday .
but if a complement for come is implied and by Tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most .
Doubt on this point is strongest before /l/ and AAb/ or /r/ .
From the point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables .
No single explanation is adequate to account for this .
By contrast , even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages .
The great majority of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping types : those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally , those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter .
They will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures .
Good field techniques will not only equip linguists for better work , but also help them overcome negative attitudes .
If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems .
Pitch differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional state to another , may far exceed the small differences between tones .
The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous , and only a small portion of them are actually used .
Apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs .
As a result , many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion .
This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early A Short Description Of Item-Categories In Iraqw .
or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory ( including three wholly separated areas ) ; ;
Swadesh , and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( ox , vulture , salmon , yellow pine , manzanita ) ; ;
2.6 and 2.7 ; ;
( 4 ) verbs ( 9 , 22 terms ) , ratios 4.0 versus 3.4 .
Or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb .
If word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot , it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually .
For Yokuts , I tabulated these 71 items in five columns , according as they were expressed by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and more than 4 stems .
When now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade , or one column or grade apart , or two or three or four , we find these differences : Af
His first conclusion , on behavior of individual items , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok. ) was partially positive .
stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86% ; ;
And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones .
And why that insistence ? ?
Some of this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence .
There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast .
Starting in great force late in December , from a line stretching from East Prussia to Budapest , the Red armies had swept two hundred miles across Poland to the Oder , thirty miles from Berlin , and the Upper Danube region was being rapidly overrun , while the Western Allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine .
In the Dunn-Atherton memorandum of February 4 , 1942 , the State Department had expected to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941 boundaries .
From six to nine million additional Germans would be evicted , though most would have fled , and Poland would receive far more from Germany than the poor territories , including the great Pripet Marshes , which she lost to Russia .
This reasoning was also as inevitable as anything could be .
`` We were troubled about the fate of the Baltic States .
There were rumors that the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process , which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened in the planned meetings .
Although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958 , the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied .
They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May , 1958 , which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held .
By December , 1958 , when ' Abdallah Ibrahim became President of the Council , elections had even greater importance .
The Istiqlal-sponsored U.M.C.I.A. ( L'Union Marocaine Des Commercants , Industrialistes et Artisans ) was opposed by candidates of the new U.N.F.P. ( L'Union National Des Forces Populaires ) in nearly all urban centers .
Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future .
The greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds .
No comparable measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training .
There are a great number and variety of private commercial schools , trade schools and technical schools .
In Arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses .
Transportation may be provided from nearby school districts .
Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry .
Proposals
There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs .
A related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided .
Local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training .
Only the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs .
A further possibility is suggested by the example of the G. I. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education : that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate .
But briefly , the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences .
Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance .
This expectation is what really `` sold '' point and figure .
They are both trend-following methods .
Even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum , the `` odds '' still favor them both , for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse .
We now know that things rarely ever work out in such cut-and-dried fashion , and that car loadings , while perhaps interesting enough , are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn .

Anyone still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what the minority loses .
My answer is in the negative because I believe that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press against available supplies , and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels .
Recent events in the General Assembly of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us , and probably intensify , for the foreseeable future .
The industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry , producing a substantial share of gross national product .
The demand for the industry's product
( We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change proportionately .
C .
The threat of effective anti-trust action , provoked by `` gouging the public '' through price increases not justified by cost increases , and fears of endangering relations with customers , Congress , the general public and the press , all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases .
In this model , we abstract from all non-wage sources of cost changes , so that the `` public-limit price '' only rises as the wage rate rises .
Whether or not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase , and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase .
As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate .
For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate ( not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living adjustments ) , and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs .
International law had to fit the conditions of Europe , and nothing that could not fit this system , or the interests of the great European nations collectively , could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense .
Essentially this imposed two conditions : First , international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another ; ;
In both respects , international law was Europeanized .
The European customs on which international law was based were to become , by force and fiat , the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states .
National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout Europe as new unifications occurred .
Particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed .
Indeed , with developed positivism , the separation of law from justice , or from morality generally , became quite specific .
It was , too , an optimistic philosophy , and , though it separated law from morality , it was by no means an immoral or amoral one .
It was not opposed to either justice or morality ; ;
it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority .
One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations .
If this seems arbitrary , its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally with citizens of the states -- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction .
Serious difficulty arose with the advent of Substantive Due Process .
The essential ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate orders .
The commission had issued an administrative order which was challenged as discriminatory against Negroes .
this in the name of equitable discretion .
Justices Frankfurter and Jackson concurred in the Court's result , for they found no merit in the railroad's claim .
In short , congressional power to grant federal-question authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress need not create , or specify , the right to be enforced .
This would satisfy what presumably was Congress' major purpose -- the suability of unions .
( As we have seen , the Erie and York decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state decisional rules .
A similar canon applies to those who press state claims in federal tribunals , e.g. , in diversity cases .
How else can one explain , for example , allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium ( section 381(c)(9) ) , but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses ; ;
Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone ; ;
The Court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties , one of them a stranger to the claim , and to prevent traffic in claims , particularly tenuous claims , against the Government .
Holding the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim , the Court cited the Seaboard , Novo Trading , and Roomberg cases for the proposition that `` transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments prohibited by the statute '' .
In an earlier case , Kingan & Co. v. United States , an American corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the British corporation .
For example , property `` used in the trade or business '' of a transferor corporation , as defined in section 1231 , presumably would not retain its special status following a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation .
This carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover .
With respect to this type of item , one might properly apply the language of the Committee Report , quoted above , which cautions against using section 381 as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein .
Is the respondent making a recommendation for his own benefit , for the benefit of his industry , for the benefit of a specific government department or service , for the benefit of the defense program , for the benefit of small business , or for the benefit of the taxpayers ? ?
Finally , there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held -- whether it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly over the alternatives .

that is to say , to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time , rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the State .
The pertinent regulation for our purposes is Section 602.2 ( , ) , as follows :
With respect to positions not covered by subparagraph ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) of this paragraph , any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists , provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral .
It is the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue .
But over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision , I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior Courts which in effect nullify the Secretary's Regulation are not a correct interpretation of the Secretary's power under the Federal law .
A decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations , and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as strikebreakers .
The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age .

Why the teacher should study the individual pupil
Some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit ; ;
Many school systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance specialists .
It is the classroom teacher , however , who has daily contacts with pupils , and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice .
One study , which involved 1,524 pupils in grades one to six , found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity .
It is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy , or that the child who lacks interest in school , who dislikes the teacher , or who is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent .
Sources of information about children
In Virginia court orders led to desegregation in Charlottesville and Floyd Counties .

On the one hand do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race ? ?
The plaintiff in school desegregation cases .
We actually have two issues in this question -- goal and method .
On the whole , it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way .
If there were more such cases , it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes .
While this influence is a complex matter , depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience , there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth .
Generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society , as they conceive it .
President Truman's Commission on Higher Education tended to take a liberal , expansionist position , while President Eisenhower's Committee on Education Beyond the High School was slightly more conservative .
The recent federal government's student-loan program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to lower-status youth .
Unfortunately , however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues .
And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service .
It might be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases .
As already noted in an earlier paragraph , the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc. .
In the first subtype , the analyst ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) distributes both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) among the different classes and units of service .
A recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required .
For example , the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge , a $5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hours of energy at
Is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred canons in social science ? ?
( cf. Rapoport , 1959 : :
The simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned .
A parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically formed .
Horowitz 1957b .
This does not mean that philosophy resolves the problems it generates , any more so than Riemann's geometry settled the physical status of the space-time continuum .
Philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve .
The ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a more durable sort of drama .
( cf. Hempel and Oppenheim , 1948 : :
As Simmel ( 1908 ) and Dilthey ( 1922 ) indicated , questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions , but assertions of faith made to appear as legitimate questions .
For what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational , i.e. , for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and irrational .
The functional interplay of philosophy and science should , as a minimum , guarantee a meaningful option to myth-making .
What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments of value ? ?
It appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only .
If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all , that they asserted nothing true or false , but merely expressed emotions like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest .
This theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind , and this I will do my best to supply .
It is as empty as the word `` Hurrah '' would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it .
And this seems to me untrue .
If goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them , those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line .
This resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also .
The force of the authors' analysis ( if indeed it has any force ) can be felt by the reader , I believe , only after three questions have been successfully answered .
( 1 ) What allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed ? ?
Obviously , a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative , if the argument is to get under way at all , for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion , any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of course , as evidence to establish the desired conclusion .
( 2 ) The patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade .
And so the authors conclude : `` The conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work , even more than the foregoing facts ( mentioned above under 1 ) , leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch , in the ordinary sense of the word , was unaffected ; ;
According to his own testimony , he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots '' of color of a more or less indefinite size ; ;
The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at all ; ;
The authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure and ( 2 ) to locate objects in space , with his eyes closed ( or turned away from the object concerned ) .
At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ;
Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors .
Many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure .
The era , however , is Janus-faced .
By 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at least on a simple plane ; ;
To the ancestral lore , however , new materials were added .
The rows of animals and birds , in particular , suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes , transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek .
On February 17 , Russell and Cook were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased .
After spending two nights ( Wednesday and Thursday ) in Catskill , the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business .
Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath , Cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank .
some buildings , farm tools , two horses , plows , and hay owned by Bonito Lavato , a friendly interpreter for the company , and Pedro Chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed ; ;
Cattle stealing and killing , again serious during the spring of 1891 , placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing position .
They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property , thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the Vermejo , and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot .
And the law virtually ignored the situation .
About 300 yards up the creek was a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square .
Receiving no answer , they set the fire .

In 1846 Matthew B. Goodwin , jeweler and watchmaker , became the town's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business `` two doors north of the Equinox House '' or `` one door north of the Bank , Manchester , Vermont '' .
In his wake came the District Traffic Supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession , ten of Boston's best , chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf .
A small single switchboard was installed in the Village over Woodcock's hardware store ( later E. H. Hemenway's ) .
Service running through Barnumville and to Bennington County towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the `` Gleason Telephone Company '' in 1925 , but major supervision of telephone lines in Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company , which eventually gained all control .
More aerial and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business .
This eliminated toll calls between the two towns .
Electric power
The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems to be one installed in Reuben Colvin's and Houghton's gristmill on the West Branch in Factory Point .
This was fortunate , as the Vail plant burned in 1905 .
First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' .
And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom .
And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so .
Surely there is nothing new about communism .
We find it in Plato's Republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book .
a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; ;
no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term .
The editor of the Newport Advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital punishment .
No sympathy or admiration for Brown could be found in the Providence Daily Post , for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy .
The Woonsocket Patriot admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A. Wise or James Buchanan '' .
A week later the Daily Journal had discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution .
In many Northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled .
The latter two were appointed secretaries .
Although admitting Brown's guilt on legal grounds , Day said that , `` Brown is no common criminal ; ;
Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas , occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory , call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered , and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice .
Picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 , when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas .
and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910 .
But here again , the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim .
Literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture , and the device boomerangs : the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before .
The actual surface becomes both ground and background , and it turns out -- suddenly and paradoxically -- that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of , upon , the surface .
and the broad , opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane .
and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts ( if it does start from a subject ) .
Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; ;
City planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might .
Meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance .
The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor .
It is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all American cities .
And wherever the new thruways go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry .
The plants along Route 128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks and trees .
In spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities .
What hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public transit is feeble .
But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago -- a new bedroom set or a winter coat , an Easter bonnet , a bicycle for Junior -- the family set off for the downtown department store , where the selection would be greatest .
In many cases that statement -- `` We break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches '' -- would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store .
Before losing itself in the sands of the 19th Century , the grand stream of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington .
He left at his death sketches , drawn to scale , for the rest of the circle .
These were carried out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini , who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania and noting in pencil , in Italian , that he `` began at this point '' .
and we were able to decide on some amplification of scale .
This last was probably not in Brumidi's palette , but was needed to take the chill , bluish look off the new work next to the old , where softening effects of time were seen , even after thorough cleaning .
We made it by Doerner's recipe , five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty ; ;
Brumidi's son later maintained that Costaggini had compressed and mutilated his father's designs , ambitiously coveting a bit he could claim for his very own .
At the very first , then , Brumidi was required , by the classically pyramidal shape of his central group , to fill in the triangular space above the seated girl on Liberty's right , before starting on the allegorical figures themselves .
Those whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me .
I am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the U.S.S.R. .
These two recollections form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which , to me at least , symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between materialism and humanism .
The socialist environment , it was stated , had cross-fertilized these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit .
Typical of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union of Soviet Artists .
It was only after we had responded , with what I fear were similar cliches , that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the U.S. Government in Cuba and Laos .
Unfortunately she returned later , just as I had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the Cultural Exchange Program would be the re-emergence of Abstract Art in Russia , with Social Realism regaining dominance in the U.S. .
Our presence here should also be considered further , sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer , peaceful ties among all people .
In spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you , we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit .
But certainly , all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for similarities between you and us , but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding .
What is missing is work that would answer , presumably by the use of survey methods and Guttman-type attitude scales , such questions as these : What are the components of the feeling-state described as alienation ? ?
Three examples follow .
Or , he might remind Fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low : after all , the medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount ; ;
While the `` empirical psychoanalytic '' label which Fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy , it does increase the marketability of his product .
The final example of the failure to use available evidence , though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered , comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same themes .
In a brief chapter dealing with `` Various Other Diagnoses '' , he quotes isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to corroborate his own , and finds it `` most remarkable that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth .
It omits , for example , practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English social critics , nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious , and all those who are with more or less accuracy called Existentialists .
Of course , the list also excludes all writers who are fairly `` optimistic '' about the modern situation ; ;
It is not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion .
The only other one I shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism .
each musical setting has an individual touch .

Varlaam's music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the wine , but he pulls himself together when the need arises .

Though he struggled with philosophy all his life , he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties ; ;

These observations about Hardy's productivity tally with the details of his life as we know them .

Like the pillars of Hercules , like two ruined Titans guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles , stand two great dead juvenile delinquents -- the heroes of the post-war generation : the great saxophonist , Charlie Parker , and Dylan Thomas .
I said , referring to the pretentious `` Jazz Concert '' .
`` Evil , man , evil '' , he said , and that's all he said for the rest of the night .
I believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value .
He was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air raids and gas ovens .
As the world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven , I believe his art became meaningless to him .
Similarly , the innovations of bop , and of Parker particularly , have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music , especially by that ignoramus , the intellectual jitterbug , the jazz aficionado .
The metaphysical conceits , which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still dominant in backwater American colleges , were embroideries .
This is one difference between Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out .
His sinuous melody is a sort of naive transcendence of all experience .
In fact , his only disciple -- the only person to imitate his style -- was W. S. Graham , who seems to have imitated him without much understanding , and who has since moved on to other methods .
Thomas's principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude -- that of the now extinct British romantic school of the New Apocalypse -- Henry Treece , J. F. Hendry , and others -- all of whom were quite conventional poets .
Parker certainly had much more of an influence .
The cubist generation before World War 1 , , and , on a lower level , the surrealists of the period between the wars , both assumed an accepted universe of discourse , in which , to quote Andre Breton , it was possible to make definite advances , exactly as in the sciences .
Nothing looks anything like an Ernst or an Arp but another Ernst or Arp .
A process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long .
he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition , and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas .
Yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment : Beowulf and the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent .
Assonance seems nearly as severe a curb , although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury declares that A Song Of Roland was intoned before the battle commenced at Hastings .
Even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage , it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition .
The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings , which provided for the difficulties of alliteration ; ;
But we can say that since a writing poet , with leisure before him , would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution , the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition .
One of the greatest Homerists of our time , Frederick M. Combellack , argues that when it is assumed The Iliad and The Odyssey are oral poems , the postulated single redactor called Homer cannot be either credited with or denied originality in choice of phrasing .
Any example of grand or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown fellow-craftsmen .
The epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet ; ;
Beowulf and the Homeric poems appear oral compositions .
Yet they are written ; ;
Other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory : Beowulf may contain a design for terror , and The Iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric Period in pottery .
The account of the growth and final transcription of these epics rests partly , however , upon the degree to which they were formulaic .
there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric colleague .
The Iliad has two words for the shield , ASPIS and SAKOS .
Such associations suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects of Dickens' novel , but , on a deeper plane , they relate to the themes of sin , guilt , and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics .
Jaggers' iron control over her ( `` she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him , hesitatingly , as if she dreaded his calling her back ) '' ) rests on his having once got her acquitted of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails .
When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give me your blackened hand '' ! !
The respectability which money confers implies a different etiquette , and , upon taking up the life of a London gentleman , Pip must learn from Herbert Pocket that `` the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under '' .

A concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on the spot .
They are still considered to be for use in restricted waters , however , and targets must come within a few yards of them .
Such mine defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase in the probability of success .
Mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets , since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target .

Because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation , a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration , fermentation , salting , chemical treatment , canning , refrigeration , and freezing .
Factors responsible for the spoilage of foods
The term `` sterilization '' applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms .
As the coating becomes thicker , the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure .
Af and Af are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife , respectively ; ;
An analysis of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle **yc and the friction angle **yt determine the vector direction Af of the force resultants R and Af .
In the first picture ( 9a ) the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation .
With increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases .
In urethane foams , for example , there has been a definite trend toward the polyether-type materials ( which are now available in two-component rigid foam systems ) and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding .
Urethane foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention .
New techniques for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost that particular material into a number of new consumer applications , including picnic chests , beverage coolers , flower pots , and flotation-type swimming toys .
foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer ; ;
Originally , the main types used were various compositions of polyesters .
The polyether glycols are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which is much desired in cushioning .
The foaming can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of catalyst in solution .
Thermal conductivity is directly traceable to the material's porous , air-cell construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which form its composition .
It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short cure , the material can be cut into lengths as desired .
Although slab stock appeared first , it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with irregular shapes , crowned contours , or rounded edges , the cutting of slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process .
In a typical application -- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels -- an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel is locked in place by a jig .
Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls .
This test method is intended for determining the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics , made of fibers other than wool , to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home .

The possibility of a space charge blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has been pointed out .
Space charge influences will also decrease at increased voltages .
A resolution of 70 - 80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible .
It should be noted that photoluminescence , due to `` Bremsstrahlung '' generated within the viewing screen by electron impact , appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess of 30 KV are utilized .
But even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and R stages .
`` An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are , the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision '' .
At the same time , every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value , and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end .
Thus Af denotes the state of the feed to the R-stage process , and Af the state of the product from the last stage .
We write this Af .
The objective function , which is to be maximized , is some function , usually piecewise continuous , of the product state .
Let Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af .
When it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal R-stage policy with respect to the feed state Af .
This will result in a value Af of the objective function , and when Af is chosen correctly this will give Af , the maximum of the objective function .
Thus Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af , and Af is related to Af by ( 5 ) .
Since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to Af , we may enter section Af of the table at this state Af and read off the optimal policy for stage Af and the resulting state Af .
It may be that the objective function depends not only on Af but also on Af , as when the cost of the operating policy is considered .
A form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is Af .
Finally , when the accelerometer output is zero , the entire system remains stationary , and the platform is , by definition , leveled .
Since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time , a practical compromise must be reached .
This leveling system will hold the platform on-level , automatically , as long as the system is actuated .
Also , it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach .

This , of course , was the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities -- putting white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly .
The wages involved were larger and more regular .
The inmates were white and from out of town , avoiding local friction .
He might have been anywhere or nowhere .
Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse , Seward's home , where Key had once been killed .
It was still Good Friday , after all .
He did not really want to kill , but as in the sexual act , there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed , even while you watched yourself giving way to it .
`` I will go '' .
He saw only dimly moving figures , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled .
Two men pulled him off .
That would have made things so much easier .
Somewhere in the fog , the nigger boy was still yelling murder .
He unhitched his horse , walked it away , mounted , and spurred it on .
The nigger boy was close behind him .
He rode on and on .
he knew he should get to Cap , but he didn't know how .
He was sure , for he had done as he was told , hadn't he ? ?
If he had any worries , it was only the small ones , about Mother in New York , and his daughter Edwina and what she might be doing at this hour , with her Aunt Asia , in Philadelphia .
She had been one of the first to collect her wits .
It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience , as that they had been stunned already .
Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke .
They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily .
The figure was so theatrically dressed , that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one .
There was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them .
Harry Hawk had not shifted position , but he at last lowered his arm .
Mrs. Lincoln screamed again .
By the look of him he wasn't that far gone .
With a bold arm , he dared once more to obstruct them .
Stevie could feel himself toppling .
The blow encountered silky hair and hard bone .
A dull boom and a throbbing echo .
He dressed , and sped outdoors .
the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street ; ;
Somewhere , beyond , where shadows lurked , must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached and the dreadful Lake of Fire .
There was no church like Drew Church , no preacher like Papa , who was intimate with Him , and could consign sinners to hellfire .
Where Cuddleback Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent swimming hole .
The mouth was thin-lipped and wide , the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide .
Burt was at Hackettstown and Will at Albany Law School , where they surely could not hear it .
if he missed it , never again .
he dared to wait for the lightning .
He trailed Ludie to the baseball game in the lot on Kingston Street near the Dutch Reformed .
A Newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size .
He wondered whether God had a dog in the sky .
A tall lady , with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom , turned insolent green eyes upon him .
They stayed at hotels and boardinghouses , or at private homes .
If the crummy bastard could write ! !
Nigger pussy .
He thought of her , the first one .
Look at thum .
Clean the place up .
Lousy Reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months .
Months .
He saw himself before them delivering the speech .
He halted , and looked around .
His old self .
But a nigger .
When I talked to Ching about it , he said , Everyone can learn , if he is not a Reactionary or lazy .
So you're not tryin , Johnson , you bastard you .
Why Slater ? ?
Top dog , sleeping and eating right there with the Staff .
Goddamn it .
Anything .
It made no sense to him .
-- name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism .
''
Goddammit .
The waves breakin in on you and your girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight .
( he asked this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut ) .
He goes to the chief himself .
To Voltaire's surprise , however , their host gives them fresh clothes to put on , opens his purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner .
How could the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges , the lies , the frauds , the errors , sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life ? ?
His operatic music had little merit .
He couldn't appear as a composer now .
`` I'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think '' , he said .
The musicians of the Royal Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound .
That would certainly be paradoxical .
But now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions ! !
Afraid at one and the same time that his work might be turned down -- which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author -- and that the work would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself .
On the contrary , he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days .
`` Why not '' ? ?
Since I am the composer '' ! !
Now times have changed , and I must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face .
But of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold at all .
`` They're a-coming ! !
I think you could have heard him a mile away , and he was bursting at every seam with importance .
but I do know that he gave the day tone and distinction .
for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight ; ;
They marched with bayonets fixed , and as fixed on their faces was anger , fear , and torment .
I had squeezed the trigger of my own gun , and to my amazement , it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule ; ;
I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a British musket ball , as Isaac had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself .
Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; ;
That settled it , and we broke into parties of two and three .
That summer the gambling houses were closed , despite the threats of Pierre Ameaux , a gaming-card manufacturer .
He finished the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor God and man .
`` We all know that Jake Camaret and the woman are brazenly living together .
`` Do not listen to that Frenchman .
`` There can be no compromise when souls are in jeopardy '' .
A week later the sentence of the Council was carried out : Jake Camaret and the woman were marched naked through the streets past a mocking populace .
How grateful he was to such men ! !
His easy good looks made him a favorite with the ladies .
And John's reply was always the same : `` Anything that affects souls is the concern of the Church ! !
`` John ? ?
What now ? ?
Slowly , like a man grown old , he took Eli's hand and led him below to the tower study , guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned .
We will not yield to the demands of Bern '' ! !
`` Arianist '' ! !
Somebody heaved a stone .
Before he could duck , another stone struck him .
`` Let him be now '' ! !
He had seen a dry , old , yellowing hand reach out , with that painful solicitude , to touch , to rearrange , to shift aimlessly , some object worth a pfennig .
The smoke from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other , and hung as sadly in the drizzle , creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof .
The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle .
`` Slice o' mutton , bhoy '' ? ?
She had queried in her soft guttural .
He demanded .
Adam looked at the pot .
`` Chicken '' , Mose said , and theatrically licked his lips .
And it squealed for slop '' .
Amy walked -- making it halfway across the cottage floor .
The comfort was short-lived , yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion .
With a hard eye , she informed Moll : `` Don't sure 'nuff me , officer .
The maid was very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique uniform .
she was one of Eliot Sparling's neutralized minorities , adopting the rolling R's and constricted vowels of Los Angeles .
The bulk of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt's conference .
However , the litter remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers .
One of the reporters called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant '' ? ?
He imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children had no unhappy romances , whose names never knew scandal .
a tiny cake of ice .
Eugene was not entirely silent , or openly rude -- unless asking Harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness .
Through the open window they heard sounds below in the street : cartwheels , a tired horse's plodding step , voices .
`` Excuse me '' , he said in Berlitz English , and got up and left them , to bathe and dress .
The first shrill ring of the telephone brought Harold out into the hall .
And a gray-haired man whose glance -- direct , lifelike , and mildly accusing -- was contradicted by the gilt and black frame .
It was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person .
The titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed wires : works on theology , astral physics , history , biology , political science .
Looked at everything .
`` I don't know what I'm going to do with you '' .
And the thing about hurt feelings , the wet bathing suit pointed out , is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be .
Fortunately , the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields .
And in any case , answers may clarify but they do not change anything .
Visually , these approximated what he was feeling within himself .
When Michelangelo explained why he had come , Rabbi Melzi replied gravely :
And sensitivity '' .
His image of the Virgin had always been that of a young woman , even as had his memory of his mother .
Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence .
Drawing and models were his thinking .
It took a piece of bad luck to show Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him .
Galli arrived with his family surgeon , Maestro Lippi .
She held Jonathan's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed .
Joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom .
Joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school .
He had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry .
Joel knew what he was about , however .
`` Everybody knows I'm just a harmless , deaf old man who takes to drink .
`` Cleaned all them Rebs out'n the hills , they did ! !
`` All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction and it were a big fight '' , the old man told them .
I wish our doctor could have saved her '' .
She asked him , seeing Juanita's eyes grow bleak .
Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions , she thought sadly .
They slept -- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring , the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table .
In the ballroom below , the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of French windows .
It was a delayed moon , but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky .
Its groin was bloody .
New York lay bleaching in the summer sun , and the morning fish hawk , flying in the heated air , saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan Island .
It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets , mostly around the Battery , going bravely north to Wall Street , but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of Harlem Heights .
On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long Island Sound .
On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn Heights .
Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber ; ;
The British ships rolled at anchor , sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London .
He looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather , looked out at King's Bridge toward Westchester .
The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston .
He hoped he was free of self-deception .
Here he was , suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war , in the spite and calumny of Whigs and Tories .
He knew that many were using it for their own ends .
Yet some , like Morris Manderscheid , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas .
Unique circumstances would test us all , he decided .
Peasants puzzled Andrei .
Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting long ago .
All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies , and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches .
All of Poland is a coffin .
By late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin , which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the Russian front .
From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point .
Lublin was the seed of action for the `` final solution '' of the Jewish problem .
In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin .
`` Not everyone , Styka '' .
`` Do you really believe that , Jan '' ? ?
What I mean is , he was a Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys .
`` I have sat many hours with this , Styka .
He was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken Polish features .
`` My cousin works at the Labor Bureau .
I'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma's fifty dollars I was spending .
It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days , and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch .
He can't object to that '' .
Never in my life have I felt so remorseful about anything I've done as I did about spending that night with my own wife .
Eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the pillow .
I turned around with the percolator in my hand .
Brown eyes , eyebrow mustache .
We didn't have time to speak before Eileen's voice was screeching at us from the bed .
I wrote her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express .
Trust Eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation .
I felt it and it ate on me all the time , but I didn't know how right I was till later .
I couldn't make out what his racket was .
He had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't have Jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm .
Greatest thing that ever happened .
Now Eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and obey , and she'd have to quit drinking .
They weren't as well paid as they should have been .
he was to try to make no converts ; ;
Hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject .
He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted .
When would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here '' ? ?
`` At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time '' .
`` How many children do you have present today '' ? ?
Konishi can help you .
Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose .
Naked girls danced in the chancel of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities .
The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish .
Alas , all that belonged to the age of `` Devil Dashwood '' and `` Wicked Wilkes '' , abbot and beadsman of the Order ! !
She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare's poem .
Byron inquired .
`` I'll tell you nothing .
This is no damned holiday , Beckworth .
It stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank .
The men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer , two of them calling him Billy .
It was easier to think now , Watson decided .
He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall and let his mind drift .
What in the name of God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river ? ?
He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion .
For what ? ?
The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy , indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs .
In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms , the two men were dragged into the same skiff .
Watson looked for the fourth man .
Watson watched the creeping figure .
If he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes , say , then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud .
Still the guards did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow-scrambling man .
Watson gesticulated wildly .
But you ain't Henry .
-- Not far .
We're almost there .
He stood with his back to the skiff .
To hell with John .
I would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming , `` O Gogol , O Chekhov , O Thackeray and Dickens , what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris ducks , a birdbath , and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps '' ? ?
Mrs. Ten Eyke did mental health .
Her hair was dyed , and her bloom was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight .
Her voice dropped .
`` Mr. Flannagan has been away for six weeks .
He travelled all over the world .
Planes made her feel faint , and in Tokyo , where she had gone that summer , she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home .
`` I've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by in the convertible .
Then he played nine imaginary holes of golf , choosing his handicap , his irons , his stance , his opponents , and his weather in detail , but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries .
Maple and ash , beech and elm , one hundred to win on Three in the fourth , fifty to win on Six in the third , one hundred to win on Two in the eighth .
Her thoughts were not discrete .
I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters .
`` That will be so nice for you , Mrs. Packard '' , she said .
She ate .
The girl , her first , she barely remembered .
He saw the land with a stranger's eyes , all the old familiarness gone .
Solid , settled lost .
`` I suppose it has to do with the property '' , Mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters .
Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea , and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness .
His sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides , and Abel looked quickly away .
He could tell they were approaching the sea .
Mark's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own , climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers , clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant .
`` Remember the Starbird ? ?
They came unexpectedly upon the sea .
He was a cagey sonofabitch .
It put you off .
`` Big Hans sent me .
The Pedersen kid .
He had long black hairs on his wrist .
`` A fat hell on Big Hans .
He's an even bigger fool than you are .
Hans had laid steaming towels over the kid's chest and stomach .
Water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was , and the dough was turning pasty , sticking to the kid's back and behind .
`` What'd he say ? ?
Did you ask him about the whisky '' ? ?
`` You'd best get that whisky '' .
`` You go .
Ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off .
Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm .
They were always trying so you got to expect it .
Pa had a knack for hiding .
But he'd find out about this one because we were using it .
I guess fooling Hans and me took doing .
I got hold his mouth open '' .
I didn't want to touch him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't make any move to .
Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner , and over his desk , next to several old and dusty hats , was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house .
He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him .
Whenever he laughed it was all he was doing .
She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road .
she could dust the plants , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on ; ;
Then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes .
She lay still on the bed , her head hardly denting the pillow ; ;
Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home , for she might die any time ; ;
The older men would be there at noon , and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town .
`` And who is this '' ? ?
`` He makes me uncomfortable '' .
`` Howard '' .
Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in the Cadillac .
It was easy to see that they were made for each other , and they knew what they wanted .
Howard sighed .
`` You lucky kids '' , he said .
but they were going up to the Big House after supper , and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little .
Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh , so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers ; ;
but she had never been so aware of anyone's flesh before .
he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights .
`` This is my hen ledger '' , he informed him in an absorbed way .
The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance ; ;
and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast .
They advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up , with gingerly steps , towards the first landing .
It was then that they heard the tread of one descending and , in some perturbation glancing up , saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing .
Alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts , trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him .
the audience attended .
The doctor instantly asked .
`` All right .
At the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes .
A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside ; ;
`` Why , Winston '' , she'd cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the jar '' ! !
But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure .
`` I told you what Miss Ada's doctor said '' .
Too many times was the truth of it , Winston thought .
He asked Leona .
She made him sad some days , and he was never sure why ; ;
it was something to do with her back , the thinness of it , and the quick , jerky way she bent .
Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward , and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier .
Since then , the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill .
Sighing , he hurried to the living room .
The china lemon tree .
`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea '' ? ?
Winston laid it in the basket .
He had only agreed with Miss Ada about getting the valet , but he had actually suggested the photograph to Mr. Jack .
`` Tell me what to get her for Christmas '' .
On Christmas night , they had had a disagreement about it .
She had asked .
He had stood at a little distance , studying her , as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head .
These letters became the center of my existence .
For many nights afterward , the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires , would cause me to lie awake in shame , tossing with irresolution , longing to fall into a deep sleep .
She was wearing her dark hair in two , thick braids to attain an `` American Girl '' effect she thought was appropriate to Halloween .
It made her look sweet and schoolgirlish , I was excited to be with her , but I did not know how to express it .
I forced confidence into myself .
There was a great sense of camaraderie .
I looked over their faces and felt a twinge : they all looked so much more knowing than I .
I looked for Jessica to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd and , as the time passed and I waited , a fiend came to life beside me and whispered in my ear : How was I planning to greet Jessica ? ?
She knew that I lived at a good address on the Gold Coast , that I had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies .
I've worked this ward for three months now .
You've not seemed like them , but maybe you are .
It's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover .
Her eyes flashed angrily .
I'll tell you why I didn't go to college ; ;
`` Do you have a boy friend '' ? ?
`` My aunt raised me .
It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary Jane Brennan should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused , sick , irresponsible person she believed me to be .
`` We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner '' , I said .
Now , riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , I knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl I had known before .
But I had the proof , all documented in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so .
Perhaps this was reality and Dale Nelson , the actor , was delusion ; ;
But because it was a suspense gangster story of the Capone era , many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in Chicago , continue as a road company , and eventually become a movie .
This let me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company , two members of which were native Chicagoans .
`` All right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink '' .
I know where the car is .
I found a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited .
Then he came out and started driving toward the beach .
I remembered it was the Peeping Tom place .
He had written out the license number of his car but had transposed the last two figures , an old dodge which is still good .
I took another sidelong glance at the other registration card , then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car .
I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed .
The powerful microphone I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation , and I was positively nauseated I was so hungry .
`` I'm in a hurry , Beautiful '' .
I said `` Darn it , that's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on .
She wanted to hang around while I was eating .
You see , she's on a diet .
`` Diets can be terrible '' , the girl said .
`` Not a bit '' , I said , `` but she's keeping her figure in hand '' .
Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door .
You know '' ? ?
It was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top .
You ain't kidding me -- the kid don't know the name of this town '' ? ?
His mouth worked over the profanity , the obscenities in his vocabulary .
Once he said , `` Why'n hell didn't you look in the back seat of the car before you drove off ? ?
She thinks she's in a ordinary garage '' .
Vince swore again .
The thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at the clock .
Grosse swore now .
Vince shouted finally , `` Get her over to Rose's and I'll come by and see that she stays put '' .
His voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled .
`` What is it '' ? ?
Grosse ducked and sniggered .
`` In a Chicago slum just like you .
Who could blame her for that ? ?
He placed a bottle opener on the counter .
Barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking .
And was he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her ? ?
Lauren Landis was in trouble and she was alone .
We're going '' .
As he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath , Marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey .
Marty smiled at Squire pleasantly and said , `` There was a cab waiting for me here .
There was another on this side , a little further down .
Then he realized the utter futility of the idea .
A foolish thought came into his head .
The fencing by the roadside ended .
It was the Ford that had been outside Burch's farm .
Marty looked helplessly in both directions .
He jumped , and sank to his knees in muddy water .
For moments he stood in water , shivering and gasping for breath .
They would be coming for him next , bearing down on him from both directions .
He did not dare climb back up to the road .
He stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there , waiting for them , a perfect target .
The weird , insane sound of the Rebel yell reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills .
`` Oh , no , not again '' , he said aloud .
`` Not again so soon '' .
There was a new sound , a sound as piercing as the Rebel yell , yet different .
Shayne looked at his watch .
That wasn't too far from Fifth Street , and should allow him to make Scotty's Bar by midnight .
`` I hope to Christ .
We've got one other call to make before I meet Alvarez '' .
`` It's parked in front '' .
He went around the corner and parked , turning off his lights and motor .
''
Maybe with specific orders to see that I don't make contact with her .
He turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to Shayne .
As the detective slid it into his pocket , Rourke asked sadly , `` What in hell are you going to do , Mike '' ? ?
He walked over to the right-hand door , opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket .
He hoped he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives , but its weight was comforting at his hip .
The big , paunchy man named Geely was on that side , half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door .
He glanced up in time to see Roberts hurtling down on him from above , literally flying through the air , his bloody face twisted .
After a moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled .
Roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps .
He was invulnerable to attack , but he could be handled , Mickey knew , if he could be brought to make the first move .
He hit Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly , then wobbled in mid-air .
They would have to .
When he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room , wiping carefully everything he might have touched .
He found the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes .
It snowed continuously , but quietly , evenly .
There was too much weight casually to toss it away .
It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off .
There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter .
It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh , poised precariously , then slid off to the ground .
Instead of the usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town squares , the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green shade of florist's grass .
If there was such a person , I'm afraid she got away with it .
Pity we don't know more about him .
I think the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a little later .
She'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment .
If you find out anything , come on back here and we'll get started on it '' .
From Baton Rouge .
`` Said she had a breaking-out on her face -- some sort of allergy -- and none of her old pictures was good enough .
I'm sure it'll be in the files .
In the basement the sheriff took him to a small , dingy office occupied by a tall , thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves .
Wants to look up something in the newspaper files , so don't lock him in here '' .
Before we built the new jail , we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded .
`` I'll leave the air conditioner on for you , Mr. Ferrell '' , said Hirey .
Hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules .
It told him little more than Mrs. Calhoun had remembered , stating that it had been a small , modest wedding compared to some of the others .
No mention of New Orleans .
The air conditioner was no longer running .
Then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind .
It was awkward : very awkward .
Someone reasonably trustworthy .
Two weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , then we make a little deal , isn't it '' ? ?
Angelo gave him an affectionate smile .
But aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held -- you could say -- the whip hand .
Who knew , Angie might not last long .
Not very much later , but when things had settled down a little .
And , Here , I'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I don't bother with it , see ! !
It wasn't as if she wanted much .
Prettier , she'd do her hair another way ; ;
Well -- I'll take it down with me as I go '' .
Maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start .
Ben and Lucien have gone after them .
I told Ben so .
So somebody else could have come in , too -- then or later while she was out of the room .
It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor .
And he certainly couldn't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding -- yes , and credible fool he had every right to expect .
That was not reasonable either .
That made a certain amount of logic .
Added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste .
there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now , it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen .
Sarah found the right key and unlocked the door .
And the fields were green and growing .
Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from Sarah's room .
Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her .
So she couldn't choose Rev as a confidant ; ;
Always provided that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude might have said it .
Try to find out how happy he is with his wife , whether he plays around with women .
You might try looking into his wife too .
He looked at his watch .
Of himself .
Gilborn passed by him without seeing him .
Someone had taken her away from him .
Where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger , there is a right-hand one , he remembered from his school days .
The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had lain .
At the end of the half-hour , racking his brains , thinking over and over again of Kitti , her friends , her past , he left the bedroom .
Why hadn't he called ? ?
She tried to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't so many after all .
Stanley really was quite predictable .
Stanley had filled out the return and because , when he was finished , it was close to the lunch hour , he had politely asked Kitti to join him , never expecting her to accept .
Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known .
`` Right '' , said the fingerprint man .
This , you will remember , was still New Year's Day .
By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up , it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats .
The meat wagon , therefore , was not out in front of the house any more , but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings .
It's not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr. Average Citizen .
He , of course , must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him , but , nonetheless , I did find his reaction startling .
If Felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because he'd forgotten about them , he now remembered .
He was dressed in a manner Esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's country weekend .
Gibby said .
`` You always live up to your name , always like this , always making happy '' ? ?
Could your future , your immediate future , be made to include taking us upstairs , giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work , and making available to him your finger tips '' ? ?
That was almost forty years ago '' .
If you can possibly avoid it , you don't hand out any extra chances .
He quickly fixed that , rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others .
None of his movements was tentative .
He was dozing , perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten .
`` She expecting me to '' ? ?
Word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire .
Andy's co-workers kept their distance , awed by the tragedy .
Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment .
However , it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside , even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose .
I can hardly wait '' .
Bake asked .
We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight .
Hub , you stick by the stage door .
Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it .
Eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy .
They did ; ;
Vecchio shouldered in .
Andy had no desire to linger himself but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them .
My God , how much more do you want '' ? ?
The old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight .
She stood frowning and chewing her lip .
She smoothed the skirt , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows .
I'm all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous .
`` Then I'd better wait until five '' .
`` No-o-o .
He had to cough then ; ;
Let her call Crosson if she wanted to , let Crosson raise the roof or even can him , he didn't care .
her motives were too blatant .
`` Mae '' --
`` They were all faded .
She shook her head .
Holden noticed almost absently how she chewed , how the whole side of her cheek moved , a slab of fat that extended down into her neck .
You're going to have to go to the police and explain what happened .
These included , as one , Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Payne , who had checked in a little after noon the day before , and had not checked out together .
Check the overnighters out .
Shrugs met that .
)
Try to forget motive for the moment .
Livingston Birdwood , producer of Uprising .
Intangibles entered , then -- hunches which felt like facts .
Because , if for no other reason , Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger , tougher , than anything else that went on two legs .
Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man may against a tiger .
He reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative .
`` Send out a pickup on Mrs. Mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on '' , Bill said .
let Stein .
Of four dark brown ears , one twitched slightly at this .
Shadow looked surprised , wailed , and trotted after her .
had only a hope .
The poor , unlucky --
The telephone rang .
Pam realized , to her surprise , that she had been almost dozing .
No other cause of death apparent .
Probably around midnight , give or take an hour either way '' .
Then he asked to use the phone and called Brian Thayer , who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o'clock .
Youngish man on the make , Madden labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion , the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions ; ;
The date , October 8 , 1957 , immediately caught the inspector's eye .
She had reason to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker's death .
Her estate had grown considerably .
With her sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons .
Twenty-five thousand to each of the great-nieces in Oregon ( not much to blood relatives out of millions ) ten thousand to this friend and that , five thousand to another ; ;
to the Pecks , ten thousand each ; ;
There was an annual audit , Garth informed him .
Ten-thousand-dollar bequest .
The undersecretary's in there .
`` Why , I'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment '' .
Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it .
Mahzeer and the prime minister are alone right now '' .
`` I want Captain Docherty '' .
He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him .
Griffith looked half-crocked to the captain ; ;
the prime minister knew who his enemy was here ; ;
he wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter .
Still , this had to be checked out .
He was unwilling to rely on Griffith's carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act on it .
He would have to do something on his own .
But what ? ?
On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests ; ;
it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible .
This would be Mahzeer's office .
He and the prime minister would be back from the window , seated at Mahzeer's desk ; ;
Mahzeer would direct the prime minister's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side .
The legation was generously set back from the building line ; ;
He peered in the boxes themselves ; ;
He opened the inner door ; ;
It was more a matter of tact , and also it was none of Killpath's goddam business .
The lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded , and as Killpath raked the comb through it , it stuck together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull .
Killpath pulled one thin leg up , clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut .
He put his chin on his kneecap , stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block , and stared wordlessly at his sergeant .
Gun waited .
`` No , sir '' .
`` Now , now , you're just guessing , Sergeant '' .
`` But you didn't know a thing about it , did you '' ? ?
But stupidity was no consolation when it had rank .
`` I was out in the district , sir '' .
He stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk .
`` Patrolman Accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer .
`` Morning , Lieutenant Rinker '' .
`` Sorry , Orville .
`` The sergeant is just leaving '' .
Not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about Killpath's little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders .
All this went through Casey's mind in the first instant , but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all .
`` Can I tell you a secret ? ?
We're going to get married .
Casey kept his smile fixed , but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about Needham , who was eight or ten years older than the girl .
In fact , he did not think about Jerry Burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him .
Only then , when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem .
Then he was striding across the room , his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note .
Jack :
Casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head .
It still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for Frank Ackerly .
He hung up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create .
So what ? ?
Casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth , and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision .
He was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes , and it took him only three more to reach the corner , a block from Columbus Avenue .
Poet came in , raising his eyebrows appreciatively as he saw Elaine .
The price tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom and looked at it curiously .
Poet nodded to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion .
There was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean .
Next to the ocean , probably the loneliest spot was the desert .
That was a hell of a note , he thought .
Nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in Southern California were over the La Jolla Deep and the Redondo Deep , two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline .
He asked .
`` Any news '' ? ?
`` Not a thing '' .
The fin on his foot caught on the moulding , throwing him off balance .
His forearm smashed painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with his other hand and rolled into the boat .
The moment the sea closed over Nick , some atavistic sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic .
Desperately , Nick flashed one hand up , catching Poet's neck in the bend of his elbow .
At once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden , wild exultation .
Relentlessly , Nick held on , sucking on the hose , inhaling the air that belonged to Poet .
It's a rich village but not much for action -- too many solid residents , not enough tourists or working stiffs .
It's at the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for a hit and run manslaughter -- about seven months ago .
Hardly expected the head of County Homicide up for this murder .
`` Never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop , Jed .
Ran a fair-sized farm .
Never had no trouble with him before , thought he was a hard worker , hustling around to get a full week's work .
Then he said , `` Never noticed it before I mean , when she was dressed but for a woman her age , Julia had a real fine figure '' .
Everything shouted gentleman farming , the kind of grandfather-father-to-son folding money the Point is known for .
The old gal stared at me with her hard eyes , said , `` She didn't call .
I drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil .
Now they were empty , except for a cottage across the road .
She hadn't seen him since .
`` Well , for this week , but they wasn't due 'till Saturday .
`` Got us an old station wagon .
If she moved gracefully , she was clumsy at it .
She was ' hiding ' on the floor of the back seat , the soft curves of her back and hips -- rousing lines .
For another moment we didn't talk , then she began to weep .
Go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite -- 1105 '' .
Besides , the number of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper .
`` Still , they may not want to rent it '' .
Stacy said he left her suite at nine forty-five p.m. .
Colt revolver in her brain .
When Alec finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk .
`` Certainly , sir '' .
The clerk was young and limp , with a tired smile .
`` That suite is taken '' .
He raised his voice .
`` Of course not '' ! !
The clerk was almost hysterical .
`` It's just that -- well , 1105 is being redecorated '' .
Show this gentleman to 1105 '' ! !
At the end of the corridor Alec noticed a door marked : Fire Stairs .
The room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window .
Alec glanced into the bathroom .
Alec heard a faint sound .
Someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window .
Something heavy shook the floor as it dropped .
The man's shoes were too pointed , his overcoat too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist .
He had seen it in the lineup at Police Headquarters in New York , in Broadway night clubs and Seventh Avenue pool rooms , in the criminal courts .
But you realize , I am sure , how much old deeds incite to new ones , and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones .
He was sharpening his razor .
His ghost is not laid .
The ' when ' you know ; ;
Places , too , have their haunting qualities .
There were no witch burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family .
A fascinating pursuit , I assure you .
It is now a sweep of boulders and ledges , with oak , walnut and sumac creeping across the common , and everywhere the ruins and the long , long shadows .
And it was because of an old Norberg inheritance that I got to understand them all so well .
I know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries , where the live wind blows , and not from the hull .
He's always like that , in spite of being a big man .
Too many outside manners , to my taste .
He too asked to see the same page .
And later in the same week they both came together to examine the register .
They actually bristled .
After the usual Honorable Sirs , it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased Salu Norberg , one lower room , on the Western side , privileges to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar ( I can show you the cellar when we go up ) , also one Cow Right , and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower , namely the Beech Pasture .
I felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence .
Not that I intentionally go unperceived , but the boulders up there are very high and I am a small woman .
One month ago , on the 20th of October , was the opening of the gunning season in Massachusetts .
But , of course , he remembered now .
Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously , but the man would have been hit if Phil hadn't called out to him a second before .
But he decided he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks , even though he made good money at his job .
I believe in returning favors .
Phil decided to stay a little longer , and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there , but for the other glass on the table .
Phil shrugged and ignored him .
He went back to work Monday .
By Wednesday the landlord was still alive .
Nobody witnessed the fall -- just the sickening impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance .
Haney went to bed , happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord .
Pete ? ?
-- he hadn't seen him sit down .
The man was uncanny , like a shadow , and made as much noise as a shadow .
He'd have to start going to some of the other places again .
I came out here to retire .
A retired professional killer If he was just a nut , no harm was done .
About halfway back Pops groped against a wall and stopped , pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end , and went through .
His `` sure-sure '' was enthusiastic this time .
When he handed it back and I had hold of it safely , Pops was looking toward me and I said `` Now '' , to Charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket , once .
-- and said it sharply , not as in the Patchen bit , but as an order -- so I stopped my hand and looked at him .
I gauged that blow to be borderline .
All right , now I'll give you a hand '' .
Winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour .
But we were really going to do it .
I was dead tired and slept soundly , as far as I know dreamlessly .
`` All right , I'll come clean .
Mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves , the many threes-fulfilled on Mars , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on Earth -- the unknown powers of three on Earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself .
My , you look chipper '' .
`` Sure , I'm hungry '' ! !
I'll switch on the floods '' .
As for the night being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on Mount Everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure ; ;
That'll be plenty to eat by '' .
Mike liked having light up through the ripples ; ;
`` I was lonely always '' .
That was almost worse than the first time '' .
Her answer was not in words .
You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me .
Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh .
`` Okay , I'm Happy .
`` That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings '' ! !
No , not he , for I , and I alone , am responsible for whatever happens to me .
`` No '' , said Macneff .
Said Hal .
I am married '' .
But , from our reading of the Western Talmud , we Urielites believe that the Forerunner , knowing this situation would arise , made reference to and provision for divorce .
So , for all practical purposes , it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government ( unrecognized outside its own borders ) .
Its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving tongues , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper .

Many years later , the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration .
This discovery caused Hal anxiety .
This is not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an Angel it takes time .
)
He had already become used to Hesperus' snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked .
But they have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young .
`` For instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth .
Recovering the property was much less important '' .
To this we of course agree '' .
Besides , agreements `` in principle '' , with the petty details to be thrashed out later , were commonplace in diplomatic history .
The Angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in all directions , seemingly at random .
The instruments don't show them '' .
No -- there was a tiny pip on the radar ; ;
The skiff was not heading for the nursery , however .
And there would be no chance of signaling them -- without the Nernst generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone .
Jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from the Nernst generator switch .
`` I'm going to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do .
`` As for my elders , they have already admitted that they were wrong .
`` How can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely '' ? ?
`` We can breathe out there , all right .
`` I'm not worried about you mis-reading the dials , Nogol , just about a lug like you reading them at all .
What killed them '' ? ?
`` The planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits , and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output .
Never at all .
He had to hide it .
The buddies invariably took advantage of him .
A man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him .
Ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the ship's library , a book by Bloch , the famous twentieth century expert on sex .
Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations , smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air .
The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him .
It fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth you've been involved in '' .
Now all the bodies are missing , like they got up and walked away '' .
I outweigh you fifty pounds and I'm fast for a big man '' .
Why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong ? ?
For her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant .
Not so obvious to her , but of more importance to her teachers , Helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid .
When they were forced to , Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the Laboratory Schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories , complete with photographs .
Very few committees ever looked past the first few photos .
She had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel .
Shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths .
Her hum became a gurgle of surprise .
`` Work '' ? ?
`` Of course , some of my color values do not match the old Master's and the perspective is faulty but I believe it to be a fair copy '' .
`` Are you referring , sir '' , asked Helva politely , `` to the Dark Age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin '' ? ?
`` I had that in mind '' .
Shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis .
Therefore to Helva , the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her .
On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship , the Aj .
There were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day Helva was commissioned .
`` Of course '' , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners .
`` No directives from Central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing '' .
Do you have anything for me '' ? ?
The two women babbled and crooned at him .
The pain was gone , though it had been crippling the first time .
Maybe I will grow another head .
the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body .
He remembered them well from his happy period .
`` Is that the name for the needle '' ? ?
This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer's thigh -- a sleeping child's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes .
Mercer turned away .
His own fate he accepted .
Nor did they care .
Each day he found himself thinking less often of Ann ; ;
each day the hurt was a little duller , a little less poignant .
He had plenty of work to do .
He had no idea how much time Budd would give him .
Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl .
There's water in the house '' .
It must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding .
Both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features .
`` What are you doing here '' ? ?
Could you give us a job , Mr. ''
`` I've been mucking in a mine in the San Juan , but I used to work on a ranch .
We'll work hard , Mr. Morgan '' .
I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep '' .
`` Think you can walk to the table '' ? ?
`` Mr. Morgan , it's the best-looking food I ever saw '' .
He said : `` You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath .
Some way '' .
I just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together ''
They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed .
`` You can't stay here with me .
It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn '' .
`` Do you remember Big Charlie '' ? ?
They just all cleared out .
God in Heaven , I can't refuse you now .
When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch .
I loved my garden '' .
`` It will grow again -- in California '' .
The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before .
The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence .
But the liquor had flushed their courage .
Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .
`` You're Gavin's son '' , Joe Purvis had said .
He made a fool of you , Lester '' .
The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley .
They dragged him inside the building .
She breathed .
`` The main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall '' .
Susan halted Dean and kissed him .
One wing stood open .
Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses .
He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body .
Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line .
He protested .
`` Dammit '' ! !
`` Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble .
You might need it .
Then he was on his way at a gallop .
His shout had been taken up and repeated .
Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post .
He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner .
Mike crawled to the door and peered in .
Ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner .
He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration .
He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house .
Bullets began to snap past him .
The guerrillas scattered for cover .
One screeched .
A sizable supply of powder had been touched off .
The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings .
The men seem to think so '' .
`` There's no war on now '' .
More of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains .
`` Let the savages kill each other .
28 .
The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ;
Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered .
At first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses' heads .
At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony .
The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder .
The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint .
The horses were only several lengths away when he fired .
A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight .
The ponies were almost uncontrollable .
It sounded like a man kicking a melon .
Now under me I could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint .
None of them reached our walls again .
And I appreciate the advice '' .
He stood watching the girl , wondering what was coming next .
`` But it's understandable .
It's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of .
`` It doesn't hurt .
`` I ought to '' -- he said .
She seemed irritated .
`` I can take care of this .
`` Who was that '' ? ?
`` I'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby '' , Wilson said .
He saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt , and he grabbed her wrist .
Her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders , held by the string , and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before .
`` Both of you .
There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief .
The land wasn't all Wilson had expected of it .
A warm breeze played across it , moving it like waves .
Since they could see me but I not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me .
His job simply consisted in registering new men .
When the phone rang he answered it .
His authority extended to the far edge of the counter , no further .
He spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality .
Once , pressing him , I learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall .
When he saw me coming he turned his radio off .
He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf .
I withdrew my hand .
I had for some time been hoping , in vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself .
It was , I felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light .
Its front was windowless , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once looked out upon the street .
As I had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application .
The staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men .
He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ;
Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head , hard .
They had chosen this night purposely .
They looked up in surprise as Powers came in .
`` He's having some kind of a fit '' .
The man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell .
They were free .
Five miles .
It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison .
Barton cursed under his breath .
He's quite a rat , you know .
Let's go get the boy '' .
It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences .
For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg , and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence .
No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless , and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life .
`` Dangerous '' ? ?
Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches .
After they had finished eating , Melissa took Sprite the kitten under her arm -- `` so that Auntie Grace can teach it about the whistle '' -- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother .
She locked the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went into the house .
If she , Pamela , were being held responsible for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation .
Was it not possible , after all , that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the Culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this ? ?
they would not dare to face his scoffing .
The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles .
She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles .
It was a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress , eclipsing the sun and human time .
In spite of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , bruising her arm on a naked stone .
She looked around .
The thought made Pamela shudder .
It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body , seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin .
She had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , depriving her of reason and sight .
Pamela groped blindly .
Twigs cracked loudly under her feet ; ;
`` I think you stink , Tom Lord ! !
Wasn't you goin' to say somethin' '' ? ?
If I could make myself feel the same way
Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone .
`` This ain't your brand , maybe '' , Lord suggested .
`` I feel like getting back to town , that's what I feel like ! !
`` What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag ? ?
Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you '' ? ?
`` What else would I mean , anyways '' ? ?
The car lurched along at a snail's crawl , the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire , occasionally scraping against the road itself .
It was the wrong thing to say .
The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him .
Don't like to bother no one unless we have to , which I figger we do , in your case .
Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots '' .
I've given willful hurt to no man .
Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it : the murder would go unpunished .
She lived by the rules , never compromising , never blinded or diverted by circumstance .
And Donna would --
But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious : the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit .
Supper would be ready within the hour .
He'd come alone , without his wife and child .
But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern .
They were sitting on their heels , rider-fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon .
Give her time to miss you .
Hell , in a year or five or ten , the boy will have forgotten me -- his own father '' ! !
If you take the one , you'd better take both '' .
Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside .
They rode to the Rockfork House , a little farther along the opposite side of the street .
But he felt no physical discomfort .
I won't '' --
Red Hogan's patience ran out .
Macklin said .
Brannon said .
Its windows glowed with lamplight .
Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure in the murky dark .
They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves , that of their own sweat , of campfire smoke , of horses and cattle .
There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near .
William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again , that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet , and once more he accused and threatened everyone .
For the unseen , ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time .
The authorities had to release him .
But there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing , the work of one of his neighbors .
And he collapsed and died instantly .
`` Sportin' '' ! !
I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to death .
The lesson had been learned .
The examples were plain .
This was the message found tacked to the cabin door .
No cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer .
( A detailed search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest .
Brenner shrugged carelessly .
`` You're not to mention my name .
Brenner continued to smile , but his eyes were cold .
Tell her to hurry '' .
Curt wanted to get Jess alone , without interference from anyone , even as spineless a person as the store owner .
''
Jess cursed again , and entered the barn .
Jess caught his breath in surprise .
`` We ain't got nothing to talk about .
`` Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house .
`` You can forget about Brenner , too '' , Curt said .
`` Arbuckle '' ? ?
If we was both armed , you wouldn't talk so tough '' .
Curt , angry enough to be a little reckless , raised his hands shoulder high .
I just wanted to hear you say so '' .
Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides .
Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention .
Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist , and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section .
It was like hitting a sack of salt .
It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet .
so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head .
He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly , putting everything he had behind them .
Even Black's old crowbait began to snort , and from the house Black yelled , `` Jess ! !
Curt was in almost as bad shape , but he wouldn't quit .
`` It was Brenner's idea '' , Jess mumbled , dabbing at his nose .
The buckskin bolted out of the stall .
Curt moved in and picked up his gun .
`` Get up , Crouch .
He shoved Black toward the stall , and pointed his pistol at Jess .
Jess asked worriedly .
Mrs. Jackson's words recalled Dan to his lack of fitness for courting .
What a spectacle he was , caked with dirt and sweat and blood , filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian , kissing the finest , the sweetest , the bravest , and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world .
He bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him .
She had spent too many hours looking ahead , hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding nothing but emptiness .
I can see Dan .
After their supper , the evening turned into a regular `` Hoe-Down '' .
Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply , `` I ain't much of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell , but I'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles '' .
With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs. Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff , Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box , to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs , and worried about all that might have happened to Sally .
And she was deeply thankful that she could see her now , out there in the midst of a gay , youthful circle , skipping and singing , `` Farmer in the dell , Farmer in the dell , Heigh-ho the dairy-oh , the farmer in the dell '' .
She was glad , completely and unselfishly glad , to see that things were working out the right way for both Sally and Dan .
For Matilda , it was the first she had known in many a night .
`` My souls' a-gracious '' ! !
`` A body would swear I floated right up here on a cloud '' ! !
`` I ain't ragging him '' ! !
Dan grinned , and changed the subject .
Heading for the batwings , Cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window , and suddenly dodged aside .
Climbing the steps steadily , they reached the top and headed for the door .
It was the barkeep .
Halting , Pat turned to survey him deliberately .
The bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it .
He said no more .
But he was more than half-drunk , and his faculties were dulled .
Straightening up , his eyes ablaze , he held out the battered Stetson .
Glowering looks met them in the bar , but there was no attempt to halt them .
He and Cobb clattered down the high steps to the street .
I've had enough .
`` I'll shove along home '' .
`` Whatever you say '' .
`` You owe it to Penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly .
`` Old Crip wasn't '' , retorted Cobb tartly .
`` You're the doctor '' , he returned with a smile .
As near as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the Antler ranch house .
Let's get out of here '' ! !
Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan .
His face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot .
But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure .
The control tower gave him immediate take-off permission , and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan .
To the west , the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes .
Stay in close and we'll go up the valley '' .
If any of us miss , they can pick up the pieces .
`` Greg to Sweeney Blue .
One pass only .
Perfect , he thought .
His nose up .
Blind fools .
Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger .
His burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane .
He fought the panic of vertigo .
His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out .
Forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old Mexican : Moriarty , New Mexico .
Adios '' , I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters .
Autos whizzed past .
`` Mor-ee-air-teeeee '' , he shrieked , his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde .
How far I knew will shortly become apparent .
When Johnson ejaculated `` Howsabout my buying us all a nice cold Co-cola , Ma'am '' ? ?
Just as p'lite an -- an cohnfidunt , an Ah says ' Uh coahse you cain't ' , but he says ' Whah nawt , you ah hevin one ' ? ?
And re-echo .
Johnson was trying to grab the wheel , though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it .
We were off the road , gleaming barbed wire pulling taut .
`` Drink your beer '' .
I bobbed my head each time it appeared .
Beyond it the gray road stretched a long , long way .
High , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof .
Suddenly and not a second too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket .
Big and dark , a melting , golden brown .
Eyes like hot honey , eyes that sizzled .
She smiled .
She was wearing nothing beneath the coat .
`` I've done several filmed commercials for '' --
Ah , you were splendid '' .
It was fun for me , all right .
`` Murder ? ?
Anyway , it was evident what he had in mind '' .
But I'm sure the other one was Lou '' .
But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor's wife , Mrs. Oatnut Grits .
But I promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort .
I shook my head .
`` Soak as long as you want , Joyce .
`` Yeah , I've heard more about SX-21 than space exploration lately .
How's it strike you , foul or fair '' ? ?
Anything else '' ? ?
`` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out .
I had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants , blooming everlastingly in the southern sun .
There was something about the contour of her face , her smile that was like New Orleans sunshine , the way she held her head , the way she walked -- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me .
You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but I am an artist , accustomed to studying the physical body .
When she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my Uncle notice it .
I felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and I a nude model .
Perhaps , with my Uncle , she found a measure of economic security that she needed ; ;
some women with father fixations do .
For several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners , and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home ; ;
`` You're the man .
I said .
I suspected why he brought it along .
You get a good , loyal husband -- smack ! !
`` Squaresville , man , and all the palazzos are crummy Palasts '' .
Five days later , on receiving it , Meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table .
Dammit ! !
He had returned to the pension a week ago .
Should she wake him ? ?
She had arrived this morning and come straight to the English Gardens .
No .
He sneezed .
The Grafin , who was charmed by her , told her , `` Your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair .
She had touched her face , truly a noble and pure face , only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual .
As she was rather tired this evening , her simple `` Thank you for the use of your bath '' -- when she sat down opposite him -- spoken in a low voice , came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control .
; ;
in reading , on platforms , even in the large auditorium of the Y.M.H.A. , Poetry Center nights , his voice was intimate , thoughtful , and a trifle shy .
His new poem , a love poem , told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed .
At her door , two or three hours later , Mary Jane whispered , `` Everyone is asleep '' .
For three days , their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea .
He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face .
`` And add fever to our troubles '' ? ?
They'll roll off in another day .
You don't even know where we're headed '' .
His wide mouth compressed .
In a way , he couldn't blame her .
The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound .
`` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks , once we find a settlement '' .
To his puzzlement , there suddenly was no haze .
They cringed under sodden covers , listening to the waves slop against the bottom .
Now and then , the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past .
The soaking will put life back in the wagon , too '' .
It speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up-jutting branch turned slowly .
Ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt , his homely face slashed with gray and crimson .
Hope surged within him .
Brassnose , Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat .
`` Let's get away fast '' , said Brassnose , shaking water from his mop of bleached hair .
`` Sommers , you bale while we row '' , Brassnose commanded .
There were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands ; ;
In a voice so frightened as to seem not his own , the big bo'sun's mate quavered :
You are welcome to Eromonga .
others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them .
Many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh .
I clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily , hoping it would make an impression on the women : `` This one is the maku Frayne .
This was the worst thing I could have said .
Miraculously , Karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of Pamasu back to their war canoes , after considerable loss of life on both sides .
Benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble .
It was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed .
When they were ready to leave , Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer .
Slender and tanned , her dark brown hair was drawn straight back , simply .
The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her .
There was nothing in particular on the man's face .
Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin .
The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again , with his fist .
Even yet there was no realization in his eyes .
Ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him .
Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment .
Some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey .
The patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis .
The fear had not entirely gone from her face , but there were some other emotions now , crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth .
She's got more guts than any other woman in the world .
And for the hundredth time that week , he was startled at her beauty .
Penny would not rise to his mood .
For a brief period each year , the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls , and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon , and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long , meandering journey to the sea -- running east past the sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga , then turning south and curling down through the jungles of Assam , past the Khasi Hills , and into Bengal , past Sirinjani and Madaripur , until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the Bay of Bengal .
He had a war reputation , but this was the kind of man women like even without medals .
That is , everyone but Keith and Penny .
The bomb was a solitary one .
Keith told Penny about his dream to return to India and Burma .
Peacocks strutted across their path , preening .
A phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty , but irreparably stringy in the neck , she was already working on her second gin and tonic , though it was not yet ten A.M.
But when it happens to you like that , I tell you , and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were -- well , it makes you think .
`` Our boy didn't chicken out , no sir .
`` Well , that's the only way to be '' , Mrs. Forsythe said , and gave her brassy laugh .
`` That's my boy '' ! !
`` Rob's not going to give up as easy as all that '' .
Now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again : Rob was his boy , the kid he had rescued from the streets , the object of his pride .
`` But surely you have misunderstood Mr. Roy .
Whatever you tell him he will dive .
`` I do not drink so much '' .
And when I make the dive again '' -- He paused ; ;
`` Holy Mary , Mother of God , Star of the Sea , stay Thou with me on this next dive .
He crossed himself again and rose .
`` Well , I was a little bit confused .
For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time .
Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide .
`` Come out , come out in the meadow '' , Matsuo said under his breath .
A signal ? ?
Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills .
faint creaking of belts and slings ; ;
Because he couldn't hear them , he was more convinced they were there .
He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear , and so he aimed above the head .
Hush followed .
He wore no head cover of any kind and , more odd , had no visible weapon .
In one : a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter , both sticky from the man's bleeding .
Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief .
Too bad the marine had no water .
The marine reached up a hand .
Not only had he no canteen , but he lacked even the belt to hang one on .
He sniffed and recognized it .
Every so often he turned the knife .
The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment .
He would soon die .
Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder .
He performed the act twice more , and the begging in his tone grew more distinct .
down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out .
He had no water for an enemy .
Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were .
`` Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town , boys '' ? ?
He straightened up , alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer .
Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin .
In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade , who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night , was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial .
`` That critter will be back tomorrow '' , predicted George Rust , `` and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him .
It was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring , ruthless gun-slinger , and this was the time-honored Wild West method of doing it .
Several were firing into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived .
Fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back .
Here he couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang .
He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book .
Leaving his rifle in the wagon , Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it .
`` Hello , Ed '' , said Tilghman .
Along each side of the room were six tiered bunks , each one screened off with a curtain .
One false move on his part and he would be a dead man .
He strolled back to the door , whistling softly , hands still clasped behind him .
If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly .
`` Don't say or do anything '' , he said softly .
`` You'll stay right here '' , commanded Bill Doolin , covering Red with his rifle .
He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew -- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him .
But they never said anything , so he figured it was all right .
She would look at Jack , with that hidden something in her eyes , and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless and a little sick .
About that time Miss Langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him , he thought , although probably she didn't even see him .
He ate litle that morning , and his mother became concerned , inasmuch as he usually ate heartily .
`` I'll be all right .
Charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the Dixie Highway , through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school .
But Jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from Charles' revelations ( even when he suspected his friend of exaggeration or invention ) , so he usually invited them , as he did now .
`` No .
What '' ? ?
`` How'd you do it '' ? ?
`` Hell , yes .
`` Time for books '' , she yelled , jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand .
`` Miss Langford , come out and play with us like you promised '' , several of the little girls called .
`` Maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress '' .
He simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class .
And so when the others stampeded out that afternoon Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window , looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner , while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed , going home .
The white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows .
He proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , Dr. Louis Lalaurie , who bore one of the South's oldest and most cherished names .
She said with intense feeling : `` Come near , let me feel your arms .
You look quite strong and healthy to me , Dandy '' .
I want you to find Monsieur Prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase .
His bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner .
Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster .
I want the room in the attic prepared for him He is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways .
His pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition .
Convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator Gaston Berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore .
The ball broke up in confusion .
After I paid Monsieur Prieur for Dandy , I brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night .
How he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , I cannot say .
Dr. Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs '' .
The excitement over Brandon's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital .
the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced down Perdido Street .
The fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice : `` Help me , somebody ! !
He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .
He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .
He grinned at them wolfishly .
She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .
He cleared his throat ; ;
`` Where'd you come from , Mr. -- uh -- Mr. Smith '' ? ?
She snapped at him .
We haven't had anything to eat all day '' .
Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .
He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .
Or the bay of female dogs in heat .
She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino '' .
This place was hatred to him , just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness .
Sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash .
He would not be like the `` rich Americans '' who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park .
He would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning .
The eyes , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality .
Mr. Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap .
`` Evadna Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old '' .
`` Well now , Maggie , you don't have to snap at me '' , Eugenia said .
The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days .
The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile High City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; ;
There weren't facilities to take care of them ; ;
Something had to be done ; ;
The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms .
`` Plenty of people are poor all their lives '' .
`` I read it , yes .
`` Pictures '' ? ?
Wait for me , Laban , I'll be dressed in half a second '' ! !
Tolley's going is my fault .
Never , `` Quit that , you sor'l devil '' ! !
She musn't annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too ! !
Human birth was no novelty to Mr. Robards .
Jenny's aversion to having Dr. Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her .
The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure .
He would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian ! !
`` Why don't you name him Jesus Christ ! !
Of course she wasn't herself right now , but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it .
It made him pretty hot under the collar , after the idea Miss Sis had given him , to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs. Robards and the children .
`` Why of course not '' , Zion said uncomfortably .
Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .
In winter , in the city , there had been the Maneret School , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; ;
But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .
Only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty's bed -- she found herself examining how others might regard her .
Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .
The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .
`` Rests the tissues '' , he said , `` and pacifies the system .
It must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses .
Man in a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .
Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` Dorothy Tredding '' seemed suddenly impossible .
`` I don't believe I know you , and I can't understand your quaint brand of English -- it was meant to be English , wasn't it '' ? ?
`` All wrong ones '' ! !
`` Uh -- sorry '' ! !
She looked around , self-consciously .
And so she was , and would remain .
after coming to America , her parents had spoken only English .
She certainly looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young men .
Perhaps a packing trip into the Sierras , let his beard grow -- but that was too stark .
He was disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door .
`` Why is that '' ? ?
She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction .
`` How did you get by the desk '' ? ?
`` I didn't say it was Christian .
`` You know '' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` I think you're going to have to excuse me .
Can't you help them '' ? ?
he heard her knocking on another door .
This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx , so he walked on down to Hurrays , an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf .
When he looked in the back , Mrs. Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards .
he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction .
Owen found Buzz watching chuck-a-luck .
He was knocking down checks at faro '' .
`` Something about the pollen '' .
`` Let's have a drink and discuss a merger '' .
Spencer said nothing .
Alexander said , `` Answer me properly , Spencer '' .
The aimless milling about of what had been a well-trained , well-organized crew struck Alexander with horror .
Mr. Heiser , does this sound like a truly workable plan to you ? ?
As soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from Spencer , we are going to be rushed .
And when he did , when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor , he knew he would lose forever the Navy to which he had dedicated his soul .
Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist .
Dear God , at what a price .
And after a while , he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity .
Stern-faced , he inspected the prisoners , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason .
Captain , I am innocent of any plot against you or the ship '' .
`` I cannot speak for others , sir , but I am innocent '' .
Now Spencer , seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy , spoke .
And though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer spoke only for Cromwell .
It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom , where a class of apprentices awaited him .
This was a training ship and the training would continue , but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which Alexander recognized .
Some of these apprentices were , in physical strength , already men and doubtless a percentage of them were Spencer's followers .
A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides .
Like the ones you will see now '' .
The dirty , discolored buildings looked boarded up , and their few windows stood high above our heads .
Little boys crowded together on long wooden benches , and in the center of the room sat the teacher .
They chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick .
His tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders .
His head barely rose above the table .
The old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps .
They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah '' .
She wished to change much for the children here '' .
When she loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved .
And I think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people .
Ready to follow her impulse .
She set out to make sure that no Jewish child anyplace in the world had to live in a place such as this '' .
Then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of Europe .
It was silent in the stone alley .
`` I know him '' .
She was limp and beaten from her loss ; ;
The big waking up had happened .
And Gratt Shafer would be in Memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along .
Because if you can't then nobody else can either , nobody else can have him .
And in a way the promise works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart .
And you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis , where he got to be a big unhappy success .
Homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway , instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart , while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments .
The bands were impatient , but they were the only ones .
The others , the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in New York City .
Each of us had his own specialty besides .
The book could be The Brothers Karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket illustration .
I remember once I did a jacket for Magpie Press ; ;
the book was a fine historical novel about Edward 3 , , and I did a week of research to get the details just right : the fifteenth-century armor , furnishings , clothes .
and in the third place , it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place -- you've got six colors there including gold '' .
He said , `` That may be , but it isn't authentic the way readers think .
As for Donald , he actually sold paintings .
I kept saying , `` If I could just build up a reputation for myself , make some real money , get to be well known as an illustrator -- like Peter Askington , for instance -- then I could take some time off and paint '' .
Askington was a kind of goal I set myself ; ;
The night we first met , at one of Mrs. Monmouth's giant parties , he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt ; ;
Life had included him in its `` Modern American Artists '' series and had photographed him at his studio in the East Sixties ; ;
the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty of Spain .
In the course of our talk , Askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying .
`` By yourself '' ? ?
He made a circle with his thumb and fingers .
I asked .
`` Osric Pendleton '' ? ?
Still painting , still a kind of modern impressionist , beautiful canvases of mountains and farms .
We hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels , and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity .
What we need is to get back to the group , to learning and apprenticeship , to the cafe and the school '' .
Actually , there was a lot of force in him , which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week .
`` What a fool I've been '' , she said quietly .
I was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace , and then the lawyer would tear up all those things
But the next day -- Sunday .
Prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember , and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove , absent itself , unsee .
The search began , in all the rooms , running upstairs , down , opening closets , talking , exclaiming in rushes and gasps .
But it seemed not from what they were saying .
Hanging on and on past any man's patience some final stab of conclusion ? ?
With all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock , a misstep .
Was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks ? ?
Even now I am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are .
In my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her , so if they told themselves that I could have prevented it , I can understand that by now and love them still , because everyone must justify , have a scapegoat for what is not to be borne .
`` We all feel guilty '' , I turned away from her coldly .
`` It was nobody's fault .
If they say I could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination , her search into herself and its conclusions .
By the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths .
`` I had a rather small place of my own .
`` Well , what about you , Carla '' ? ?
She asked , turning slowly .
`` What's the matter with them '' ? ?
Look at them '' .
`` Sam , no one around here wears such heavy soles .
`` And I don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit '' , she said , making a face .
When they got home at midnight she was tired out .
It would be good for her .
From the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know .
It was all too wearying .
Look somewhere else .
It seemed to him that if the Ferraros felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla .
`` Why not '' ? ?
The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee .
But very mystical too .
No , he was indeed a saint now .
Did Signor Raymond understand ? ?
Early Spring came from her bed , from beside her half-drunk husband , Walitzee , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion , the sound of hushed voices .
But the girl said only , `` Tell him I am here , that I have come '' .
And Early Spring seized the whip and said :
`` If you must flog someone , let it be her , your daughter .
`` Go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women .
Keep him back , if you must tell me what to do .
But she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness , smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from TuHulHulZote .
But they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics .
They went into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons .
Walitzee whitened his leggings with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees .
And the suspicious , envenomed eyes of Pile of Clouds .
He felt so much like laughing ; ;
but she found the path she always used , the stubs of branches she had broken , those she had pushed aside ; ;
They were becoming confused .
Oh God ! !
He was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him .
His fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy .
He was drinking another glass of water .
It was after seven o'clock .
`` Pietro's driving me .
She asked him .
`` I'll call your mother as soon as I get home .
He stood up .
`` Oh , just sort of everything in general '' .
`` Yes , perhaps .
I'm supposed to joke about things , aren't I ? ?
Don't work too hard '' .
`` I bumped into a door handle '' , George said .
''
`` They make us conformists look good '' .
Susan ready '' ? ?
You'll see , Myra's settling down '' .
whenever Lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or fuss , to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra .
Get moving '' ! !
The only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless , selfish sister of his .
And when you get back from Grandma's , Cathy will be here to play with you .
It isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's nests .
`` Websterville Junction calling '' , she said .
she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her .
Cowbird Myra ! !
His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here .
He was a knight of the Round Table , `` Sir Quintus the Brave '' , slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses .
When you get back I'll probly be swimming better than Victoria .
Or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime : `` Please , Lord Gord , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised '' .
I can't go in .
He snapped .
`` Isn't '' .
`` Is '' .
They started with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of eighteen '' --
Not having said `` hell '' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum .
`` Why don't you paint it red and white like a barber pole '' ? ?
Quint glared .
Come home or I'll come find you '' .
As for dancing -- holy mackerel , he ought to see the gypsies in Jerez ; ;
Sometimes they argued .
Next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the V-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around .
He had to go into the water .
Then there was a spat over something , as there had been lovers' spats before ; ;
It wasn't even John and Edythe .
John was good at his job .
But he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ;
But now -- well , it would be a blessing , I think .
Linda Evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed Bobbie's death could move her to feeling .
`` Now , I believe Poor John'll work just a little harder .
I answered to find Nadine at the other end .
`` Oh , she wouldn't do that '' , I said .
I'll call you there in ten minutes '' --
Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give me .
Her face was flushed from sleep .
I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' .
I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone .
I told Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home .
Well , there wasn't any law that said I had to stay ! !
Her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out , and if looks could kill , Wally would have been dead .
`` You stay out of this '' , she spat at me .
And the other people there were listening ! !
`` Tea , '' Nadine screeched .
Wally's lost his job ! !
`` I'd had all this trouble with the old man , that's why I drank so much .
Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side .
`` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman '' ! !
They had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their necks , owing on everything they owned .
Worst of all , Wally had no training for any kind of work .
It was easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent .
Well , now she can sleep in the street for all I care '' ! !
Then I felt uncomfortable , too .
`` The high school kids have got everything sewed up '' , he said , a whine in his voice .
`` By fall they'll be back in school '' , I'd say , trying to sound encouraging .
And I couldn't take six more weeks of this .
Part of it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late .
But the rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all .
As usual , Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table .
I looked at the chart for reassurance .
One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled .
`` I've got the results on the Bancroft smear test '' , he said .
There was something almost insulting in her tone , but I disregarded it .
`` I've just been talking to Dr. Michelson '' , I said .
That's quite minor , nothing to worry about .
`` No '' .
Even if we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably '' .
`` No '' .
I'd had patients who'd refused surgery before , of course , but never one who didn't show , in one way or another , the reason why .
`` You shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door '' , she said .
`` I've got cancer , haven't I '' ? ?
She went on , disregarding my protests .
I stared at her , almost speechless .
`` I never asked you for any favors , Joe '' , she went on , `` but I'm asking one now .
If I let her go , she'd disappear once more .
Once before I had been to Paris , long before I married Valery .
That's what was on my mind .
I was just miserable .
Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick .
I knew all about her .
It's really rotten to drink good cognac like that , but I hadn't cared before .
I suppose we were cold , but we didn't feel it .
I was hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital .
`` What is this for '' ? ?
The coffee wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good .
`` You are very tactful , do you know , Stephen '' , she remarked .
`` I carry one in my purse .
We had champagne and steamed mussels .
England , France , Germany , Switzerland , and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics , she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight , to see all these places with her own eyes .
Marvelous , thought Theresa , climbing in her portly , well-bred way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything .
Other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above , watching the azaleas mass , or just enjoying the sun .
how could you be both at once ? ?
Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago .
He was full of heavy family reminiscence .
He had hobbled downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his bathrobe , on a footstool .
They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan .
He was younger than Theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused .
But there is more in this than meets the eye .
`` No , no '' ! !
Theresa Stubblefield , still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between Cousin Elec's death and `` doing something '' about Cousin Emma .
It never registered with them that I had time to read all of Balzac , Dickens , and Stendhal while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after Mother's operation .
I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck .
Johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line .
She wouldn't have , even if he'd asked her .
It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time .
Yet even then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little .
You wouldn't '' .
I wanted him , with a terrifying fierceness .
`` Will you always love me this way '' ? ?
I had had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no certificate of marriage , but I had all the joy that goes with them .
I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love , and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God , my promise to remain pure until I was married .
There would have been a ceremony if it had been possible .
So I went to Boston .
`` I -- I don't think so , Ronald .
`` No -- really '' .
In the cold light of day , it seemed a lunatic arrangement .
And where was the thing ? ?
The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi ; ;
From now on , his was going to be a man's world : the North Woods , duck blinds at dawning , beer and poker and male secretaries .
In these damp circumstances , he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia .
His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ;
`` Would you mind wrapping your onion '' ? ?
Said this note .
He got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` Be my guest '' on the wrapping .
I mean , she's still living , and she's ninety-six .
But then , redheads are often pale .
Up on a dune , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting .
`` Of course I don't mind '' , she answered .
Now Vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy .
Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to subside , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion .
There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot .
But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late .
The fighters were separated in a few minutes .
Mike yelled to the catcher .
Only Mike got to his feet .
It was a cold and calculated look .
The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike's head .
In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil's ear : `` There's gonna be a fight '' .
Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head .
Eddie Lee had not come in yet .
`` Well ! !
Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , Rossoff '' ! !
Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door .
`` No '' , Eddie said .
Phil stood up .
You haven't got the heart for baseball '' .
Baseball's no cinch .
He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on .
Phil said : `` I got my release '' .
Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again .
Phil looked up .
`` Sure '' , he said .
At dinner one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god '' .
As for The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York .
He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames .
Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried .
In time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity .
She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations .
`` Well , it's at Fudomae and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool .
I've been there a number of times .
That night , after leaving Charlotte's apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room .
He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him .
I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful .
He was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly .
I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die .
My head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish .
I knew the boy well .
I looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ;
I pointed to the splintered , upright stake .
He tried to take my hand to show me .
`` You saw the colors of it , didn't you ? ?
I wrenched the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body , between the colored diamond crystals .
And then it moved a little more , and I knew the snake was dying , and I would have to kill it there .
`` I'm going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed '' .
`` Don't you see the difference now '' ? ?
I thought , you little brute , you nasty , selfish , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes .
Tax worries , production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from Hanford College , his own alma mater , a real snapper .
Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago .
Height , 6' .
A woman had it or she didn't .
She said what she meant and let it be .
He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator .
Cady looked at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years .
`` Board meeting tonight , Cady '' ? ?
`` Hear anything from Hanford yet , Dad '' ? ?
Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot .
`` And he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club .
Don't worry , Cady , he'll be back in the Beethoven fold by next year '' .
Anne folded the worrisome document .
He hasn't used it now for several years .
For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back .
They had left themselves too much to discover .
Martin gave her a teasing pat .
For he had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests .
She'll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings .
At first he could not be sure .
A glissade of giggles slid over their voices .
For some reason , this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic .
About this time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough .
Here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by .
Of course , the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts .
To them all Dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale .
`` You were in a hurry , weren't you '' ? ?
His mind scurried frantically , seeking an exit .
Sooner or later , Dolores would crack .
The tale , he thought , would become less gay .
Extending her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room .
She did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady .
They breakfasted together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible .
The conversion will cost a fortune .
`` Which is a frightful prospect , Bill '' .
Not to William's surprise , Freddy , Adam and Hamilton Richert prevailed ; ;
Through Jack Hamrick , William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for Shoals and Clay .
Adam , beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end .
William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick .
Initially , Hamrick's reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was discouraging .
Then he caught fire .
They took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white .
You mustn't take a fall , or publicly back away .
I hate that .
Forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' .
Sure , Ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the Big Three .
Heads instinctively turned in Willis' direction .
On their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants .
The detective , commenting on Barco's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged -- that he was a more or less harmless `` nut '' ! !
A man of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity .
No one knew .
So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly :
`` Barco , we've got the goods on you ! !
But if true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into headlines all over America as the hero of a great murder trial .
He queried .
''
Stopping the cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills , and indicated a location .
With quibs and gibes , the policemen again started digging .
`` There's something here '' ! !
Although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains , it was enough .
Then , noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds , he made his way to the Byzantine room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the rostrum .
But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts .
There was to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself .
Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice .
Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like Jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black out , Miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles .
How about them , I thought .
Francesca and Herbert were among the few people we knew in Catatonia .
They were `` personalities '' .
She was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and , having arrived in New York with a big bank roll , became a dabbler in various fields .
Fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by wearing Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in colors ; ;
Sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human .
Besides Francesca , there was Blanche .
She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive .
all were fellows of finite charm .
I never thought I'd live to hear people chuckle and say `` zounds '' ! !
In real life .
people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ;
They're not even food .
They're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast '' .
Could it do otherwise ? ?
Even though I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled .
`` Ah , you're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' .
a `` splash party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ;
As Letch's antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable `` screenland '' gathering .
